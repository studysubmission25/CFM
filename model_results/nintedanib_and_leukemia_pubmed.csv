38096958,Cost in the United States of FDA-approved small molecule protein kinase inhibitors used in the treatment of neoplastic and non-neoplastic diseases.,Roskoski R Jr,Pharmacol Res. 2024 Jan;199:107036. doi: 10.1016/j.phrs.2023.107036. Epub 2023 Dec 12.,2024 Jan,S1043-6618(23)00392-4 [pii] 10.1016/j.phrs.2023.107036,199,,107036,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38096958,"Because genetic alterations including mutations, overexpression, translocations, and dysregulation of protein kinases are involved in the pathogenesis of many illnesses, this enzyme family is the target of many drug discovery programs worldwide. The FDA has approved 80 small molecule protein kinase inhibitors with 77 drugs orally bioavailable. The data indicate that 69 of these medicinals are approved for the management of neoplasms including solid tumors such as breast and lung cancer as well as non-solid tumors such as leukemia. Moreover, the remaining 11 drugs target non-neoplastic diseases including psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis, and ulcerative colitis. The cost of drugs was obtained from www.pharmacychecker.com using the FDA label to determine the dosage and number of tablets required per day. This methodology excludes any private or governmental insurance coverage, which would cover the entire cost or more likely a fraction of the stated price. The average monthly cost for the treatment of neoplastic diseases was $17,900 with a price of $44,000 for futibatinib (used to treat cholangiocarcinomas with FGFR2 fusions) and minimum of $5100 for binimetinib (melanoma). The average monthly cost for the treatment of non-neoplastic diseases was $6800 with a maximum of $17,000 for belumosudil (graft vs. host disease) and a minimum of $200 for netarsudil eye drops (glaucoma). There is a negative correlation of the cost of the drugs and the incidence of the targeted disease. Many of these agents are or were designated as orphan drugs meaning that there are fewer than 200,000 potential patients in the United States."
36895976,Antineoplastic efficacy profiles of avapritinib and nintedanib in KIT D816V(+) systemic mastocytosis: a preclinical study.,"Degenfeld-Schonburg L, Gamperl S, Stefanzl G, Schruef AK, Sadovnik I, Bauer K, Smiljkovic D, Eisenwort G, Peter B, Greiner G, Hadzijusufovic E, Schwaab J, Sperr WR, Hoermann G, Kopanja S, Szepfalusi Z, Hoetzenecker K, Jaksch P, Reiter A, Arock M, Valent P",Am J Cancer Res. 2023 Feb 15;13(2):355-378. eCollection 2023.,2023,,13,2,355-378,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36895976,"Systemic mastocytosis (SM) is a hematopoietic neoplasm with a complex pathology and a variable clinical course. Clinical symptoms result from organ infiltration by mast cells (MC) and the effects of pro-inflammatory mediators released during MC activation. In SM, growth and survival of MC are triggered by various oncogenic mutant-forms of the tyrosine kinase KIT. The most prevalent variant, D816V, confers resistance against various KIT-targeting drugs, including imatinib. We examined the effects of two novel promising KIT D816V-targeting drugs, avapritinib and nintedanib, on growth, survival, and activation of neoplastic MC and compared their activity profiles with that of midostaurin. Avapritinib was found to suppress growth of HMC-1.1 cells (KIT V560G) and HMC-1.2 cells (KIT V560G + KIT D816V) with comparable IC(50) values (0.1-0.25 microM). In addition, avapritinib was found to inhibit the proliferation of ROSA(KIT WT) cells, (IC(50): 0.1-0.25 microM), ROSA(KIT D816V) cells (IC(50): 1-5 microM), and ROSA(KIT K509I) cells (IC(50): 0.1-0.25 microM). Nintedanib exerted even stronger growth-inhibitory effects in these cells (IC(50) in HMC-1.1: 0.001-0.01 microM; HMC-1.2: 0.25-0.5 microM; ROSA(KIT WT): 0.01-0.1 microM; ROSA(KIT D816V): 0.5-1 microM; ROSA(KIT K509I): 0.01-0.1 microM). Avapritinib and nintedanib also suppressed the growth of primary neoplastic cells in most patients with SM examined (avapritinib IC(50): 0.5-5 microM; nintedanib IC(50): 0.1-5 microM). Growth-inhibitory effects of avapritinib and nintedanib were accompanied by signs of apoptosis and decreased surface expression of the transferrin receptor CD71 in neoplastic MC. Finally, we were able to show that avapritinib counteracts IgE-dependent histamine secretion in basophils and MC in patients with SM. These effects of avapritinib may explain the rapid clinical improvement seen during treatment with this KIT inhibitor in patients with SM. In conclusion, avapritinib and nintedanib are new potent inhibitors of growth and survival of neoplastic MC expressing various KIT mutant forms, including D816V, V560G, and K509I, which favors the clinical development and application of these new drugs in advanced SM. Avapritinib is of particular interest as it also blocks mediator secretion in neoplastic MC."

The results of the dose-finding phase 1 part have been previously published. Patients were randomized 1:1 to LDAC plus nintedanib or LDAC plus placebo stratified by AML status (newly diagnosed vs r/r). LDAC was applied subcutaneously at 20 mg twice daily on days 1 to 10. Nintedanib/placebo was orally administered twice daily on days 1 to 28 in 28-day cycles. The primary endpoint was overall survival (OS). Between 05/2017 and 09/2019, 31 patients were randomized and 30 were treated, before the study was terminated prematurely due to slow recruitment. Median (range) age of patients was 76 (60-84) years. Twenty-two patients (73%) had r/r AML. Median OS in patients treated with LDAC and nintedanib was 3.4 months, compared with 3.6 months in those treated in the placebo arm, with a HR adjusted for AML status of 1.19 (corresponding confirmatory adjusted 95% CI, 0.55-2.56; univariate log-rank P = 0.96). In the 22 patients with r/r AML, median OS was 3.0 months in the nintedanib and 3.6 months in the placebo arm (P = 0.36). One patient in the nintedanib and two patients in the placebo arm achieved a CR and entered maintenance treatment. Nintedanib showed no superior therapeutic activity over placebo when added to LDAC in elderly AML patients considered unfit for intensive chemotherapy. The trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov NCT01488344."

There is urgent need of novel strategies to target poor prognosis subgroups, like PAX5 translocated. METHODS: We considered 289 childhood BCP-ALL cases consecutively enrolled in Italy in the AIEOP-BFM ALL2000/R2006 protocols and we performed extensive molecular profiling, integrating gene expression, copy number analyses and fusion genes discovery by target-capture NGS. We developed preclinical strategies to target PAX5 fusion genes. FINDINGS: We identified 135 cases without recurrent genetic rearrangements. Among them, 59 patients (43.7%) had a Ph-like signature; the remaining cases were identified as ERG-related (26%), High-Hyperdiploid-like (17%), ETV6::RUNX1-like (8.9%), MEF2D-rearranged (2.2%) or KMT2A-like (1.5%). A poor prognosis was associated with the Ph-like signature, independently from other high-risk features. Interestingly, PAX5 was altered in 54.4% of Ph-like compared to 16.2% of non-Ph-like cases, with 7 patients carrying PAX5 fusions (PAX5t), involving either novel (ALDH18A1, IKZF1, CDH13) or known (FBRSL1, AUTS2, DACH2) partner genes. PAX5t cases have a specific driver activity signature, extending to multiple pathways including LCK hyperactivation. Among FDA-approved drugs and inhibitors, we selected Dasatinib, Bosutinib and Foretinib, in addition to Nintedanib, known to be LCK ligands. We demonstrated the efficacy of the LCK-inhibitor BIBF1120/Nintedanib, as single agent or in combination with conventional chemotherapy, both ex vivo and in patient-derived xenograft model, showing a synergistic effect with dexamethasone. INTERPRETATION: This study provides new insights in high-risk Ph-like leukaemia and identifies a potential therapy for targeting PAX5-fusion poor risk group.

Epub 2022 Jul 22.,2022 Sep,S1043-6618(22)00307-3 [pii] 10.1016/j.phrs.2022.106362,183,,106362,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35878738,"The Janus kinase (JAK) family of nonreceptor protein-tyrosine kinases consists of JAK1, JAK2, JAK3, and TYK2 (Tyrosine Kinase 2). Each of these proteins contains a JAK homology pseudokinase (JH2) domain that interacts with and regulates the activity of the adjacent protein kinase domain (JH1). The Janus kinase family is regulated by numerous cytokines including interferons, interleukins, and hormones such as erythropoietin and thrombopoietin. Ligand binding to cytokine receptors leads to the activation of associated Janus kinases, which then catalyze the phosphorylation of the receptors. The SH2 domain of signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT) binds to the cytokine receptor phosphotyrosines thereby promoting STAT phosphorylation and activation by the Janus kinases. STAT dimers are then translocated into the nucleus where they participate in the regulation and expression of dozens of proteins. JAK1/3 signaling participates in the pathogenesis of inflammatory disorders while JAK1/2 signaling contributes to the development of myeloproliferative neoplasms as well as several malignancies including leukemias and lymphomas. An activating JAK2 V617F mutation occurs in 95% of people with polycythemia vera and about 50% of cases of myelofibrosis and essential thrombocythemia. Abrocitinib, ruxolitinib, and upadacitinib are JAK inhibitors that are FDA-approved for the treatment of atopic dermatitis. Baricitinib is used for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and covid 19. Tofacitinib and upadacitinib are JAK antagonists that are used for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and ulcerative colitis. Additionally, ruxolitinib is approved for the treatment of polycythemia vera while fedratinib, pacritinib, and ruxolitinib are approved for the treatment of myelofibrosis."

However, despite their disease-modifying potential, KIT D816V-targeting drugs, including midostaurin and avapritinib, may not produce long-term remissions in all patients. Cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) 4 and CDK6 are promising targets in oncology. We found that shRNA-mediated knockdown of CDK4 and CDK6 results in growth arrest in the KIT D816V(+) MC line HMC-1.2. The CDK4/CDK6 inhibitors palbociclib, ribociclib, and abemaciclib suppressed the proliferation in primary neoplastic MC as well as in all HMC-1 and ROSA cell subclones that were examined. Abemaciclib was also found to block growth in the drug-resistant MC line MCPV-1, whereas no effects were seen with palbociclib and ribociclib. Anti-proliferative drug effects on MC were accompanied by cell cycle arrest. Furthermore, CDK4/CDK6 inhibitors were found to synergize with the KIT-targeting drugs midostaurin, avapritinib, and nintedanib in inducing growth inhibition and apoptosis in neoplastic MCs. Finally, we found that CDK4/CDK6 inhibitors induce apoptosis in CD34+/CD38- stem cells in AdvSM. Together, CDK4/CDK6 inhibition is a potent approach to suppress the growth of neoplastic cells in AdvSM. Whether CDK4/CDK6 inhibitors can improve clinical outcomes in patients with AdvSM remains to be determined in clinical trials."

Therefore, KIT D816V represents a prime therapeutic target for SM. Here, we generated a panel of patient-specific KIT D816V induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from patients with aggressive SM and mast cell leukemia to develop a patient-specific SM disease model for mechanistic and drug-discovery studies. KIT D816V iPSCs differentiated into neoplastic hematopoietic progenitor cells and MCs with patient-specific phenotypic features, thereby reflecting the heterogeneity of the disease. CRISPR/Cas9n-engineered KIT D816V human embryonic stem cells (ESCs), when differentiated into hematopoietic cells, recapitulated the phenotype observed for KIT D816V iPSC hematopoiesis. KIT D816V causes constitutive activation of the KIT tyrosine kinase receptor, and we exploited our iPSCs and ESCs to investigate new tyrosine kinase inhibitors targeting KIT D816V. Our study identified nintedanib, a US Food and Drug Administration-approved angiokinase inhibitor that targets vascular endothelial growth factor receptor, platelet-derived growth factor receptor, and fibroblast growth factor receptor, as a novel KIT D816V inhibitor. Nintedanib selectively reduced the viability of iPSC-derived KIT D816V hematopoietic progenitor cells and MCs in the nanomolar range. Nintedanib was also active on primary samples of KIT D816V SM patients. Molecular docking studies show that nintedanib binds to the adenosine triphosphate binding pocket of inactive KIT D816V. Our results suggest nintedanib as a new drug candidate for KIT D816V-targeted therapy of advanced SM."

The US FDA approved four small molecule protein kinase antagonists in 2019; these include entrectinib, erdafitinib, pexidartinib, and fedratinib. Entrectinib binds to TRKA/B/C and ROS1 and is prescribed for the treatment of solid tumors with NTRK fusion proteins and for ROS1-postive non-small cell lung cancers. Erdafitinib inhibits fibroblast growth factor receptors 1-4 and is used in the treatment of urothelial bladder cancers. Pexidartinib is a CSF1R antagonist that is prescribed for the treatment of tenosynovial giant cell tumors. Fedratinib blocks JAK2 and is used in the treatment of myelofibrosis. Overall, the US FDA has approved 52 small molecule protein kinase inhibitors, nearly all of which are orally effective with the exceptions of temsirolimus (which is given intravenously) and netarsudil (an eye drop). Of the 52 approved drugs, eleven inhibit protein-serine/threonine protein kinases, two are directed against dual specificity protein kinases, eleven target non-receptor protein-tyrosine kinases, and 28 block receptor protein-tyrosine kinases. The data indicate that 46 of these drugs are used in the treatment of neoplastic diseases (eight against non-solid tumors such as leukemias and 41 against solid tumors including breast and lung cancers; some drugs are used against both tumor types). Eight drugs are employed in the treatment of non-malignancies: fedratinib, myelofibrosis; ruxolitinib, myelofibrosis and polycythemia vera; fostamatinib, chronic immune thrombocytopenia; baricitinib, rheumatoid arthritis; sirolimus, renal graft vs. host disease; nintedanib, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis; netarsudil, glaucoma; and tofacitinib, rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn disease, and ulcerative colitis. Moreover, sirolimus and ibrutinib are used for the treatment of both neoplastic and non-neoplastic diseases. Entrectinib and larotrectinib are tissue-agnostic anti-cancer small molecule protein kinase inhibitors. These drugs are prescribed for the treatment of any solid cancer harboring NTRK1/2/3 fusion proteins regardless of the organ, tissue, anatomical location, or histology type. Of the 52 approved drugs, seventeen are used in the treatment of more than one disease. Imatinib, for example, is approved for the treatment of eight disparate disorders. The most common drug targets of the approved pharmaceuticals include BCR-Abl, B-Raf, vascular endothelial growth factor receptors (VEGFR), epidermal growth factor receptors (EGFR), and ALK. Most of the approved small molecule protein kinase antagonists (49) bind to the protein kinase domain and six of them bind covalently. In contrast, everolimus, temsirolimus, and sirolimus are larger molecules (MW  approximately  1000) that bind to FK506 binding protein-12 (FKBP-12) to generate a complex that inhibits the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) protein kinase complex. This review presents the physicochemical properties of all of the FDA-approved small molecule protein kinase inhibitors. Twenty-two of the 52 drugs have molecular weights greater than 500, exceeding a Lipinski rule of five criterion. Excluding the macrolides (everolimus, sirolimus, temsirolimus), the average molecular weight of the approved drugs is 480 with a range of 306 (ruxolitinib) to 615 (trametinib). More than half of the antagonists (29) have lipophilic efficiency values of less than five while the recommended optima range from 5 to 10. One of the troublesome problems with both targeted and cytotoxic drugs in the treatment of malignant diseases is the near universal development of resistance to every therapeutic modality."

Intriguingly, a trial with the antifibrotic drug nintedanib in non-small cell lung cancer reported clinical benefits in adenocarcinoma (ADC) but not squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), even though the stroma is fibrotic in both histotypes. Likewise, we reported that nintedanib inhibited the tumor-promoting fibrotic phenotype of TAFs selectively in ADC. Here we show that tumor fibrosis is actually higher in ADC-TAFs than SCC-TAFs in vitro and patient samples. Mechanistically, the reduced fibrosis and nintedanib response of SCC-TAFs was associated with increased promoter methylation of the profibrotic TGFbeta transcription factor SMAD3 compared with ADC-TAFs, which elicited a compensatory increase in TGFbeta1/SMAD2 activation. Consistently, forcing global DNA demethylation of SCC-TAFs with 5-AZA rescued TGFbeta1/SMAD3 activation, whereas genetic downregulation of SMAD3 in ADC-TAFs and control fibroblasts increased TGFbeta1/SMAD2 activation, and reduced their fibrotic phenotype and antitumor responses to nintedanib in vitro and in vivo. Our results also support that smoking and/or the anatomic location of SCC in the proximal airways, which are more exposed to cigarette smoke particles, may prime SCC-TAFs to stronger SMAD3 epigenetic repression, because cigarette smoke condensate selectively increased SMAD3 promoter methylation. Our results unveil that the histotype-specific regulation of tumor fibrosis in lung cancer is mediated through differential SMAD3 promoter methylation in TAFs and provide new mechanistic insights on the selective poor response of SCC-TAFs to nintedanib. Moreover, our findings support that patients with ADC may be more responsive to antifibrotic drugs targeting their stromal TGFbeta1/SMAD3 activation. SIGNIFICANCE: This study implicates the selective epigenetic repression of SMAD3 in SCC-TAFs in the clinical failure of nintedanib in SCC and supports that patients with ADC may benefit from antifibrotic drugs targeting stromal TGFbeta1/SMAD3."

29263244,Triple Angiokinase Inhibitor Nintedanib Directly Inhibits Tumor Cell Growth and Induces Tumor Shrinkage via Blocking Oncogenic Receptor Tyrosine Kinases.,"Hilberg F, Tontsch-Grunt U, Baum A, Le AT, Doebele RC, Lieb S, Gianni D, Voss T, Garin-Chesa P, Haslinger C, Kraut N",J Pharmacol Exp Ther. 2018 Mar;364(3):494-503. doi: 10.1124/jpet.117.244129. Epub 2017 Dec 20.,2018 Mar,10.1124/jpet.117.244129,364,3,494-503,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29263244,"The triple-angiokinase inhibitor nintedanib is an orally available, potent, and selective inhibitor of tumor angiogenesis by blocking the tyrosine kinase activities of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR) 1-3, platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR)-alpha and -beta, and fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) 1-3. Nintedanib has received regulatory approval as second-line treatment of adenocarcinoma non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), in combination with docetaxel. In addition, nintedanib has been approved for the treatment of idiopathic lung fibrosis. Here we report the results from a broad kinase screen that identified additional kinases as targets for nintedanib in the low nanomolar range. Several of these kinases are known to be mutated or overexpressed and are involved in tumor development (discoidin domain receptor family, member 1 and 2, tropomyosin receptor kinase A (TRKA) and C, rearranged during transfection proto-oncogene [RET proto oncogene]), as well as in fibrotic diseases (e.g., DDRs). In tumor cell lines displaying molecular alterations in potential nintedanib targets, the inhibitor demonstrates direct antiproliferative effects: in the NSCLC cell line NCI-H1703 carrying a PDGFRalpha amplification (ampl.); the gastric cancer cell line KatoIII and the breast cancer cell line MFM223, both driven by a FGFR2 amplification; AN3CA (endometrial carcinoma) bearing a mutated FGFR2; the acute myeloid leukemia cell lines MOLM-13 and MV-4-11-B with FLT3 mutations; and the NSCLC adenocarcinoma LC-2/ad harboring a CCDC6-RET fusion. Potent kinase inhibition does not, however, strictly translate into antiproliferative activity, as demonstrated in the TRKA-dependent cell lines CUTO-3 and KM-12. Importantly, nintedanib treatment of NCI-H1703 tumor xenografts triggered effective tumor shrinkage, indicating a direct effect on the tumor cells in addition to the antiangiogenic effect on the tumor stroma. These findings will be instructive in guiding future genome-based clinical trials of nintedanib."

Epub 2017 Nov 3.,2017 Dec 21,10.1182/blood-2017-05-784603,130,25,2750-2761,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29101238,"Pediatric T-acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) patients often display resistance to glucocorticoid (GC) treatment. These patients, classified as prednisone poor responders (PPR), have poorer outcome than do the other pediatric T-ALL patients receiving a high-risk adapted therapy. Because glucocorticoids are administered to ALL patients during all the different phases of therapy, GC resistance represents an important challenge to improving the outcome for these patients. Mechanisms underlying resistance are not yet fully unraveled; thus our research focused on the identification of deregulated signaling pathways to point out new targeted approaches. We first identified, by reverse-phase protein arrays, the lymphocyte cell-specific protein-tyrosine kinase (LCK) as aberrantly activated in PPR patients. We showed that LCK inhibitors, such as dasatinib, bosutinib, nintedanib, and WH-4-023, are able to induce cell death in GC-resistant T-ALL cells, and remarkably, cotreatment with dexamethasone is able to reverse GC resistance, even at therapeutic drug concentrations. This was confirmed by specific LCK gene silencing and ex vivo combined treatment of cells from PPR patient-derived xenografts. Moreover, we observed that LCK hyperactivation in PPR patients upregulates the calcineurin/nuclear factor of activated T cells signaling triggering to interleukin-4 (IL-4) overexpression. GC-sensitive cells cultured with IL-4 display an increased resistance to dexamethasone, whereas the inhibition of IL-4 signaling could increase GC-induced apoptosis in resistant cells. Treatment with dexamethasone and dasatinib also impaired engraftment of leukemia cells in vivo. Our results suggest a quickly actionable approach to supporting conventional therapies and overcoming GC resistance in pediatric T-ALL patients."

Epub 2017 Jun 15.,2017 Aug,10.3324/haematol.2016.155747,102,8,1401-1412,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28619847,"Lyn, a member of the Src family of kinases, is a key factor in the dysregulation of survival and apoptotic pathways of malignant B cells in chronic lymphocytic leukemia. One of the effects of Lyn's action is spatial and functional segregation of the tyrosine phosphatase SHP-1 into two pools, one beneath the plasma membrane in an active state promoting pro-survival signals, the other in the cytosol in an inhibited conformation and unable to counter the elevated level of cytosolic tyrosine phosphorylation. We herein show that SHP-1 activity can be elicited directly by nintedanib, an agent also known as a triple angiokinase inhibitor, circumventing the phospho-S591-dependent inhibition of the phosphatase, leading to the dephosphorylation of pro-apoptotic players such as procaspase-8 and serine/threonine phosphatase 2A, eventually triggering apoptosis. Furthermore, the activation of PP2A by using MP07-66, a novel FTY720 analog, stimulated SHP-1 activity via dephosphorylation of phospho-S591, which unveiled the existence of a positive feedback signaling loop involving the two phosphatases. In addition to providing further insights into the molecular basis of this disease, our findings indicate that the PP2A/SHP-1 axis may emerge as an attractive, novel target for the development of alternative strategies in the treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia."

Maternal embryonic leucine zipper kinase (MELK) is highly expressed in TNBC, where level of overexpression correlates with poor prognosis and an aggressive disease course. Herein, we describe the discovery through targeted kinase inhibitor library screening, and structure-guided design of a series of ATP-competitive indolinone derivatives with subnanomolar inhibition constants towards MELK. The most potent compound, 17, inhibits the expression of the anti-apoptotic protein Mcl-1 and proliferation of TNBC cells exhibiting selectivity for cells expressing high levels of MELK. These studies suggest that further elaboration of 17 will furnish MELK-selective inhibitors with potential for development in preclinical models of TNBC and other cancers."

This phase I study evaluated nintedanib in combination with low-dose cytarabine (LDAC) in elderly patients with untreated or relapsed/refractory acute myeloid leukemia (AML) ineligible for intensive chemotherapy in a 3+3 design. Nintedanib (dose levels 100, 150, and 200 mg orally twice daily) and LDAC (20 mg subcutaneous injection twice daily for 10 days) were administered in 28-day cycles. Dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) was defined as non-hematological severe adverse reaction CTC grade >/= 4 with possible or definite relationship to nintedanib. Between April 2012 and October 2013, 13 patients (median age 73 [range: 62-86] years) were enrolled. One patient did not receive study medication and was replaced. Nine (69%) patients had relapsed or refractory disease and 6 (46%) patients had unfavorable cytogenetics. The most frequently reported treatment-related adverse events (AE) were gastrointestinal events. Twelve SAEs irrespective of relatedness were reported. Two SUSARs were observed, one fatal hypercalcemia and one fatal gastrointestinal infection. Two patients (17%) with relapsed AML achieved a complete remission (one CR, one CRi) and bone marrow blast reductions without fulfilling PR criteria were observed in 3 patients (25%). One-year overall survival was 33%. Nintedanib combined with LDAC shows an adequate safety profile and survival data are promising in a difficult-to-treat patient population. Continuation of this trial with a phase II recommended dose of 2 x 200 mg nintedanib in a randomized, placebo-controlled phase II study is planned. The trial is registered to EudraCT as 2011-001086-41. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01488344."
