40468182,A case of cirrhosis concurrent with NK/T-Cell lymphoma and hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis: a clinical report and literature review.,"Li D, Xiang X",BMC Infect Dis. 2025 Jun 4;25(1):793. doi: 10.1186/s12879-025-11179-9.,2025 Jun 4,10.1186/s12879-025-11179-9 793,25,1,793,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40468182,"OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate the clinical manifestations and therapeutic strategies for cirrhosis concurrent with NK/T-cell lymphoma and hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH), to enhance diagnostic and therapeutic insights into this rare disease with triple comorbidity. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed the clinical data and diagnostic-therapeutic workflow of a patient admitted to our hospital in August 2024 with cirrhosis, NK/T-cell lymphoma, and HLH. RESULTS: The patient was admitted to the Department of Infectious Diseases of our hospital with cirrhosis of unknown origin. Laboratory findings demonstrated trilineage cytopenia, coagulopathy, deranged blood biochemistry, markedly elevated ferritin, and hypercytokinemia. Serological testing confirmed Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) antibody positivity, while molecular assays detected high EBV DNA loads. Bone marrow cytomorphology and cervical lymph node histopathology corroborated NK/T-cell lymphoma with HLH. Whole-body PET/CT revealed multifocal lymph node involvement. Following multidisciplinary evaluation, the patient underwent hematology-directed management combining hepatoprotective therapy, antimicrobials, and chemotherapy (gemcitabine/oxaliplatin/mitoxantrone liposome), stabilizing disease. CONCLUSION: The co-occurrence of cirrhosis, NK/T-cell lymphoma, and HLH represents a rare clinical entity with a grim prognosis. This case highlights the necessity of early recognition and coordinated multidisciplinary interventions to optimize outcomes."

This phase 2 trial aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of chidamide, an orally active HDAC inhibitor, plus the R-GemOx regimen for relapsed/refractory (R/R) DLBCL. METHODS: Patients with transplantation-ineligible R/R DLBCL received chidamide (20 mg, oral, days 1, 4, 8, 11, 15, and 18), rituximab (375 mg/m(2), day 1), gemcitabine (1000 mg/m(2), day 2), and oxaliplatin (100 mg/m(2), day 2) in a 21-day cycle for 6 cycles (induction phase), followed by chidamide (20 mg, oral, twice weekly on Mondays and Thursdays) until disease progression or intolerable toxicity (maintenance phase). The primary endpoint was overall response rate (ORR). RESULTS: Between June 19, 2019 and July 5, 2022, 54 patients were enrolled. The ORR was 59.3% (95% CI: 45.0-72.4). With a median follow-up of 38.1 months (interquartile range: 19.5-48.2), the median progression-free survival and overall survival were 7.4 (95% CI: 5.2-14.2) and 23.9 (95% CI: 15.2-not reached) months, respectively. The most common grade 3/4 treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were neutropenia (40.7%), thrombocytopenia (33.3%), and leukopenia (27.8%). Whole-exome sequencing showed that CREBBP mutations and BTG2 mutations were associated with poor response and survival. CONCLUSION: Chidamide plus R-GemOx demonstrated promising anti-tumor activity with acceptable toxicities in transplantation-ineligible R/R DLBCL patients. Patients with CREBBP mutations and BTG2 mutations had inferior response and survival. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT04022005."
40262078,"Peripheral Neuropathy Incidence in Children, and Adolescents and Young Adults With Cancer and Medicaid Insurance in California.","Abrahao R, Cooley JJP, Kahn JM, Brunson A, Alvarez EM, Mahajan A, Wun T, Verma R, Ruddy KJ, Keegan THM",JCO Oncol Pract. 2025 Apr 22:OP2400748. doi: 10.1200/OP-24-00748.,2025 Apr 22,10.1200/OP-24-00748,,,OP2400748,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40262078,"PURPOSE: Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy is a potentially debilitating adverse effect of cancer therapy that can lead to delay, reduction, or discontinuation of cancer treatment. Population-based data on peripheral neuropathy incidence among young cancer survivors are lacking. METHODS: Using a linkage between Medicaid, the California Cancer Registry, and hospitalization and emergency department data, we identified 6,028 adolescents and young adults (15-39 years) with Hodgkin lymphoma (HL), non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), breast cancer, colorectal cancer, or testicular cancer and 418 children (<15 years) with HL or NHL during 2005-2017. We determined the cumulative incidence of peripheral neuropathy and its association with neurotoxic chemotherapy identified from Medicaid claims, using multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression models. RESULTS: Of 6,446 patients, 1,007 were diagnosed with peripheral neuropathy. Across each cancer type, incidence was higher among patients receiving neurotoxic drugs. For example, compared with non-neurotoxic agents, 5-year cumulative incidence was higher with oxaliplatin for colorectal cancer (24.0% v 6.2%) and paclitaxel for breast cancer (22.6% v 5.1%). In multivariable analysis, the agents most strongly associated with peripheral neuropathy were brentuximab (+/-other neurotoxic drugs) for HL (hazard ratio [HR], 9.53 [95% CI, 5.95 to 15.26]); brentuximab (+/-vinca alkaloids; HR, 7.00 [95% CI, 4.13 to 11.87]) for NHL, paclitaxel for breast cancer (HR, 4.03 [95% CI, 3.05 to 5.31]); oxaliplatin for colorectal cancer (HR, 3.46 [95% CI, 2.23 to 5.36]); and cisplatin and etoposide for testicular cancer (HR, 2.06 [95% CI, 1.37 to 3.11]). CONCLUSION: The high incidence of peripheral neuropathy highlights the need for frequent monitoring, new supportive care approaches, and development of novel therapeutic agents to minimize toxicity while maintaining treatment efficacy."
40191721,Comparison of pegaspargase with concurrent radiation vs. P-GEMOX with sequential radiation in early-stage NK/T-cell lymphoma.,"Feng D, Bai S, Chen G, Fu B, Song C, Tang H, Wang L, Wang H",Oncol Res. 2025 Mar 19;33(4):965-974. doi: 10.32604/or.2024.057065. eCollection 2025.,2025,10.32604/or.2024.057065,33,4,965-974,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40191721,"OBJECTIVES: The optimal treatment strategy for early-stage natural killer/T-cell lymphoma (NKTCL) remains unclear. This study aimed to evaluate and compare the clinical outcomes and adverse events (AEs) associated with two treatment regimens for early-stage NKTCL: pegaspargase with concurrent radiation therapy (P+CCRT) and pegaspargase, gemcitabine, and oxaliplatin (P-GEMOX) with sequential radiation therapy (SERT). Propensity score matching (PSM) was employed to ensure balanced comparison between these regimens. METHODS: We assessed the efficacy of P+CCRT from a phase II trial and P-GEMOX combined with SERT using real-world data. PSM was conducted at a 1:1 ratio with a caliper of 0.18 to align baseline characteristics between the treatment groups. Key outcomes analyzed included overall response rate (ORR), complete response rate (CR), progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and AEs. RESULTS: Following PSM, the study included 52 patients, with 26 in each treatment group. Baseline characteristics were balanced between the cohorts. The ORR for P+CCRT group was 100.0% compared to 88.5% for P-GEMOX+ SERT group, and the CR rates was 100.0% vs. 76.9%, respectively. The 3-year OS and PFS rates were both 92.3% for P+CCRT, while P-GEMOX showed 92.3% OS and 80.8% PFS. Adverse events, including hematological toxicity, hepatotoxicity, and coagulation dysfunction, were comparable between the two regimens. CONCLUSION: P+CCRT is associated with comparable clinical outcomes compared to P-GEMOX + SERT in early-stage NKTCL, with comparable adverse events. Additionally, P+CCRT offers the benefit of a more streamlined treatment regimen with a shorter cycle. Given these encouraging results, further cohort studies are needed to validate these results."

METHODS: A budget impact model was developed for a hypothetical blended commercial/Medicare health plan with 1,000,000 members. Comparators were axicabtagene ciloleucel (Axi-cel), lisocabtagene maraleucel (Liso-cel), tisagenlecleucel (Tisa-cel), loncastuximab tesirine, polatuzumab vedotin + bendamustine + rituximab, rituximab + gemcitabine + oxaliplatin, tafasitamab + lenalidomide, and epcoritamab (Epcor). Total costs included those for drugs, wastage, administration, grade >/=3 adverse reactions, and all-grade cytokine release syndrome) and routine care. Market shares were based on internal projections and expert opinions. Total and per-member per-month (PMPM) net budget impacts over 3 years were calculated. RESULTS: Approximately nine patients were projected to be eligible for 3L + DLBCL treatment in a health plan of 1,000,000 members. The introduction of glofitamab as a treatment option resulted in estimated total and PMPM cost savings of $728,697 and -$0.0202, respectively, over 3 years. Costs were reduced across all cost categories but particularly in drug costs. Among the newer therapies, total 3-year cost per treated patient was lowest for glofitamab: $226,658 versus Tisa-cel = $564,113; Axi-cel = $540,002; Liso-cel = $516,272; and Epcor = $335,293. Across all sensitivity analyses, the inclusion of glofitamab had minimal PMPM budget impact, ranging from -$0.0256 to -$0.0108. CONCLUSIONS: With the lowest 3-year total cost per treated patient among the newer therapies, glofitamab being an available option in the 3L + DLBCL market is estimated to save a hypothetical 1,000,000-member health plan $728,697 in cumulative total costs and $0.0202 in PMPM costs over 3 years."

A total of 97 patients were retrospectively evaluated. The relationships between baseline PETCT metabolic parameters and survival were tested using Cox regression analysis and receiver operating characteristic(ROC) curve analysis was employed to evaluate the optimal cut-off value of these parameters. Kaplan-Meier curves with log-rank tests were used for survival analysis. At a median follow-up of 49 months, the 3-year PFS and OS were 62.9% and 70.1%. SUVmean, SUVmax, and SUVpeak were related to both PFS and OS in univariate analysis(P < 0.05 for all). Further multivariate analysis including PET/CT parameters and clinical parameters revealed that SUVmean was an independent prognostic factor and seemed to be slightly superior to SUVmax and SUVpeak. The low SUVmean was significantly associated with a better prognosis (3-year OS 85.1% vs.65.0%, P = 0.014; 3-year PFS 76.8% vs.62.1%, P = 0.032). SUVmean was able to further separate patients with a low-risk PINK/PINKE of < 2(n = 85, 79, separately) into two subgroups with significantly different outcomes. Moreover, the metabolic-parameter-contained m-PINK/PINKE model was constructed and showed superior predictive performance in the whole cohort. Conclusions. SUVmean was an independent prognostic factor in patients with ENKTL treated with P-GEMOX chemotherapy. Adding SUVmean to the PINK or PINKE model could improve the predictive value and further distinguish patients with poor outcomes."

PATIENTS AND METHODS: We conducted a phase I study of romidepsin, gemcitabine, oxaliplatin and dexamethasone (Romi-GemOxD) in R/R aggressive lymphomas with an expansion cohort in T-cell lymphomas. A total of 24 patients were enrolled with median age 70; 6 patients had diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and 18 patients had peripheral T-cell lymphomas (PTCL-NOS: 10; angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma [AITL]: 7; ALK-negative anaplastic large cell lymphoma: 1). Patients had received a median of 2 prior lines of therapy and 10 patients were refractory to last line of therapy. RESULTS: Using a standard 3 + 3 dose escalation design, the maximum tolerated dose of romidepsin was determined to be 10 mg/m(2) in combination with GemOxD. There were no unexpected toxicities. The most common grade >/= 3 treatment-emergent adverse events were thrombocytopenia (79%) and lymphopenia (46%). The overall response rate for Romi-GemOxD was 52% (12/23) with complete response (CR) rate of 43% (10/23). All 6 patients with AITL evaluable for efficacy achieved CR. Durable responses were seen in patients with AITL, PTCL-NOS and DLBCL. Without additional therapy, 4 patients remained in remission for more than 2 years, with 3 patients progressing at 46.5, 30.8, and 32.6 months and 1 remission ongoing at 83 months. A total of 4 patients proceeded to consolidative stem cell transplant following induction.

In this review, we identify and address the unique challenges encountered in the care of OA with DLBCL. We elaborate on the role and limitations of current geriatric assessment (GA) tools and ways to incorporate fitness in therapeutic decision making. We suggest best practices to implement GA in routine practice and clinical trials. The most widely used tool is simplified GA (sGA) which categorizes patients into fit, unfit and frail groups. Patients who are fit benefit from full dose/curative approach, whereas consideration should be made to reduce the intensity of chemotherapy for unfit patients. Frail patients with DLBCL are a major unmet need without any satisfactory treatment options. Ongoing investigations combining novel therapies into chemotherapy-free regimens are underway with promising early results. In the relapsed/refractory (R/R) setting, anti-CD19 CAR-T cell therapy (CART) is now the standard of care for primary refractory disease or relapse within 12 months of completing therapy. Autologous stem cell transplant is still a consideration for fit OA with relapse >12 months after completing therapy. The recent approval of bispecific antibodies is a welcome advance that will greatly benefit OA not eligible for CART. Other regimens available for patients ineligible for CART or for those who experience progression post-CART include polatuzumab-rituximab+/-bendamustine, tafasitamab-lenalidomide, loncastuximab or chemotherapy-based approaches such as rituximab-gemcitabine-oxaliplatin. We discuss the changing paradigm in R/R DLBCL and spotlight emerging data from recent congresses that can improve outcomes in this vulnerable population."

Efficacy analyses were by intention to treat in all randomly assigned patients. We present results from both the primary analysis (cutoff: March 29, 2023) and updated analysis after all patients had completed study therapy (cutoff: Feb 16, 2024). Safety analyses included all patients who received any study treatment. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04408638, and is ongoing (closed to recruitment). FINDINGS: From Feb 23, 2021, to March 14, 2023, 274 patients were enrolled and randomly assigned to receive Glofit-GemOx (n=183) or R-GemOx (n=91). 158 (58%) patients were male and 116 (42%) were female; median age was 68 years (IQR 58-74). At the primary analysis after a median follow-up of 11.3 months (95% CI 9.6-12.7), overall survival was significantly improved with Glofit-GemOx versus R-GemOx (median not estimable [NE; 95% CI 13.8 months-NE] vs 9.0 months [7.3-14.4]; hazard ratio [HR] 0.59 [95% CI 0.40-0.89]; p=0.011). At the updated analysis after a median follow-up of 20.7 months (19.9-23.3), a consistent improvement in overall survival was observed with Glofit-GemOx versus R-GemOx (median 25.5 months [18.3-NE] vs 12.9 months [7.9-18.5]; HR 0.62 [0.43-0.88]). In the safety sets, 180 (100%) patients in the Glofit-GemOx group and 84 (96%) of 88 patients in the R-GemOx group had at least one adverse event during the study period. Cytokine release syndrome occurred in 76 (44%) of 172 glofitamab-exposed patients and was predominantly low grade. Deaths related to glofitamab or rituximab occurred in five (3%) patients in the Glofit-GemOx group and in one (1%) patient in the R-GemOx group. INTERPRETATION: Glofit-GemOx had a significant overall survival benefit compared with R-GemOx, supporting its use in transplant-ineligible patients with relapsed or refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma after one or more previous lines of therapy.

METHODS: Patients with nodal PTCL who initiated salvage therapy with sintilimab and GemOx between January 2020 to September 2021 were identified from the database of the hematology department of the Second Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University School of Medicine. All patients received 2-4 cycles (3 weeks/cycle) of treatment of sintilimab (200 mg, I.V, D1) in combination with GemOx. Treatment response was assessed every six weeks during the salvage treatment phase. Eligible patients received maintenance therapy according to the investigator's decision. Follow-ups were routinely conducted every three months. RESULTS: 31 patients with r/r nodal PTCLs were enrolled, including 23 PTCL-NOS, 4 AITL, and 4 ALCL. 21 (67.7%) patients received at least two lines of therapy. 71.0% (95% CI, 53.4%-83.9%) of patients documented objective response of 2-4 cycles of sintilimab plus GemOx therapy, including 9 complete response and 13 partial response. 21 (67.7%) patients received consolidation therapy, including 5 autologous stem-cell transplantation and 12 histone deacetylase inhibitors. After a median 25.6 months follow-up, the median PFS was 22.0 (95% CI,11.8-24.7) months, and the median OS was 26.2 (95% CI, 24.4 -NA) months. 29 (93.5%) patients experienced at least one adverse event, and 26 (83.9% patients only had mild (grade 1-2) AEs.Univariable Cox regression showed the progression risk of AITL is 22.7 (3.9- 131.0, p < 0.01) times of PTCL-NOS, while the HR of ALCL was 1.14 (0.33-3.96,p = 0.833). CONCLUSION: Sintilimab plus GemOx showed encouraging activity and manageable toxicity for patients with r/r PTCL."

Previously, magrolimab (anti-cluster-of-differentiation-47 antibody) plus rituximab (M+R) demonstrated ability to induce complete responses (CR) in R/R DLBCL. Here, we report 3-year follow-up data from this phase 1b/2 study assessing long-term safety and efficacy of M+R, and initial safety and efficacy of M+R plus gemcitabine-oxaliplatin (M+R-GemOx), in R/R DLBCL. After magrolimab priming, 4 groups of patients received M+R, 10 to 45 mg/kg magrolimab with 375 mg/m2 rituximab; patients receiving M+R-GemOx received 30 or 45 mg/kg magrolimab with 375 mg/m2 rituximab, 1000 mg/m2 gemcitabine, and 100 mg/m2 oxaliplatin. Primary end points were treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) and objective response rate (ORR). Secondary end points included duration of response (DOR), progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS). Of 132 patients treated, 99 received M+R and 33 received M+R-GemOx. Most common any-grade TEAEs were fatigue (M+R, 40%; M+R-GemOx, 70%), infusion-related reactions (M+R, 39%), or anemia (M+R-GemOx, 70%). Treatment-related TEAEs led to magrolimab discontinuation in 7% (M+R) and 6% (M+R-GemOx). One death was considered treatment related (M+R-GemOx, colitis). M+R ORR was 24% (CR, 12%), and median DOR was 9.3 months. Median PFS and OS were 1.8 and 9.2 months, respectively. M+R-GemOx ORR was 52% (CR, 39%); 12-month DOR rate was 66.6% (95% confidence interval, 33.1-86.1). Median PFS and OS were 3.9 months and not reached, respectively. These results demonstrate that M+R with/without GemOx is well tolerated, and M+R-GemOx has clinical activity in patients with R/R DLBCL.

We conducted a study investigating the combination of selinexor with rituximab and platinum-based chemotherapy in B-cell lymphoma. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We conducted a phase 1b, dose-escalation, and expansion trial, which enrolled patients with relapsed or refractory B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Patients received oral selinexor according to a 3 + 3 design in combination with rituximab and dexamethasone, high-dose cytarabine, oxaliplatine (DHAOX) or gemcitabine, dexamethasone, and cisplatin (GDP) chemotherapy. RESULTS: A total of 39 patients were enrolled, 27 during the escalation phase and 12 during the expansion phase. Most patients had diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL; 77%). Group R-DHAOX was prematurely closed to inclusion due to a recommendation from the French drug agency, independent of this trial. A recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of selinexor in association with R-GPD was established at 40 mg on days 1, 8, and 15 of each 21-day cycle. In a population of 18 patients treated at this dose of selinexor, the most frequent grade 3-4 adverse events were hematological. With this regimen, seven obtained a complete metabolic response and five a partial response. The median PFS was 5.8 months. CONCLUSIONS: Among the patients with R/R B-cell lymphoma, selinexor at a weekly dose of 40 mg with R-GDP is feasible for outpatients, with a generally acceptable safety profile."

Novel and effective therapeutic strategies are needed to improve clinical outcomes, particularly in relapsed/refractory patients. METHODS: We conducted a multicenter phase 2 study to evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of azacitidine and chidamide, alone or in combination with gemcitabine and oxaliplatin (GemOx), in patients with relapsed/refractory PTCLs (registration number: ChiCTR2000037232). The primary endpoint was the best overall response rate. FINDINGS: As of May 1st, 2024, thirty patients were evaluable for efficacy and toxicity. The best overall response rate was 53.3%, meeting its primary endpoint. Among the patients with angioimmunoblastic T cell lymphoma (AITL; N = 19), a numerically higher response rate was observed, regardless of whether chemotherapy was combined, compared to patients with non-AITL. After a median follow-up of 36.6 months, median progression-free survival and overall survival were 7.1 and 8.7 months, respectively. Patients with AITL who received combination chemotherapy (N = 12) achieved the most promising response rates (overall response rate, 91.7%; complete remission rate, 66.7%) and survival outcomes (median progression-free survival, 17.2 months; median overall survival, 38.8 months). The most common grade 3-4 toxicities were neutropenia (40.0%) and thrombocytopenia (30.0%). CONCLUSIONS: The combination of epigenetic therapy with GemOx was well tolerated and highly effective in patients with relapsed/refractory PTCLs. Patients with AITL, in particular, may benefit more from this combination treatment and should be the focus of future studies.

Thus, we evaluated the safety and efficacy of atezolizumab plus rituximab and GemOx (R-GemOx+Atezo) in R/R transformed DLBCL, including Richter transformation. We conducted a phase I trial including patients with transformed DLBCL after >/=1 prior therapy. Patients received up to four cycles of R-GemOx+Atezo. Patients in complete remission could then proceed to R-Atezo maintenance until progression. A safety lead-in with evaluation of dose-limiting toxicity was performed to confirm the recommended phase II dose; subsequently the treatment was administered to two expansion cohorts: one with transformed follicular lymphoma (FL) and the other with non-FL transformed DLBCL, including Richter transformation. Twenty-seven patients were enrolled. One of the six patients in the safety lead-in had a dose-limiting toxicity attributed to atezolizumab, a grade 4 Stevens-Johnson syndrome. The most common grade >/=3 events were neutropenia (18.5%), lymphopenia (18.5%), and thrombocytopenia (14.8%). The overall and complete response rates were 59% and 33%, respectively.

The costs vary depending on the respective treatment regimen and the treatment duration, difficult comparability in reimbursement decisions. The objective was to analyze the health economic impacts of novel 2 L interventions and conventional immunochemotherapies (bendamustine-rituximab [BR], rituximab-gemcitabine-oxaliplatin [R-GemOx]) from a German healthcare payer's perspective as a function of treatment duration. METHODS: An economic model was developed to compare treatment costs of 2 L interventions depending on the treatment duration. Treatment duration was measured by progression-free survival (PFS), identified based on a systematic review. Total and average costs were calculated over 5 years to evaluate incremental costs at median PFS for each intervention. RESULTS: Average costs per month at median PFS ranged from euro2846 (95% CI: 5067-1641) to euro40 535 (95% CI: 91180-N/A) for BR and liso-cel, respectively.

39088680,,,,2024 Jun,,,,,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39088680,"WHAT IS THE REIMBURSEMENT RECOMMENDATION FOR EPKINLY? We recommend that Epkinly be reimbursed by public drug plans for the treatment of adults with relapsed or refractory (r/r) diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) not otherwise specified, DLBCL transformed from indolent lymphoma, high-grade B-cell lymphoma, primary mediastinal B-cell lymphoma, or follicular lymphoma grade 3B after 2 or more lines of systemic therapy and who have previously received or are unable to receive chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy for a time-limited period while additional evidence is generated if certain conditions are met. Please note that time-limited reimbursement refers to temporary reimbursement by the drug programs while additional evidence is generated and submitted for reassessment (i.e., this does not refer to the length of treatment or number of cycles administered). WHICH PATIENTS ARE ELIGIBLE FOR COVERAGE? Epkinly should only be covered to treat adults who have DLBCL, not otherwise specified, DLBCL transformed from indolent lymphoma, high-grade B-cell lymphoma, primary mediastinal B-cell lymphoma, or follicular lymphoma grade 3B that has come back or that did not respond to 2 or more previous treatments for their cancer, and who have also previously received CAR T-cell therapy, declined CAR T-cell therapy, or cannot receive CAR T-cell therapy. WHAT ARE THE CONDITIONS FOR REIMBURSEMENT? Epkinly should only be reimbursed if not given in combination with other anticancer drugs. Reimbursement of Epkinly should be discontinued if a patient's cancer grows or spreads or if the treatment is unacceptably toxic to the patient. Epkinly should only be reimbursed when prescribed by specialists with experience managing large B-cell lymphoma (LBCL), and if its cost is reduced. WHY IS REIMBURSEMENT RECOMMENDED IN A TIME-LIMITED MANNER? A time-limited recommendation is a recommendation to publicly fund a drug or drug regimen for a certain period of time on the condition the sponsor will generate additional data that addresses uncertainty in the evidence. Health Canada requires the sponsor to complete a phase III study and confirm that Epkinly improves survival in patients with DLBCL compared to bendamustine and rituximab (BR) or rituximab, gemcitabine, and oxaliplatin (R-GemOx). Given that there is uncertainty in the magnitude of clinical benefit with Epkinly, reimbursement has recommended in a time-limited manner and is contingent on a reassessment of the comparative efficacy and cost-effectiveness when the results of the phase III study are available from the sponsor. WHY DID WE MAKE THIS RECOMMENDATION? Evidence from 1 clinical trial suggested that treatment with Epkinly may improve survival and increase the time until the cancer grows or spreads. Additionally, 40% of patients treated with Epkinly experienced a disappearance of all signs and symptoms of cancer (i.e., completely responded to treatment). Epkinly may meet some important patient needs by providing another treatment option that delays disease progression and has manageable side effects. Based on an assessment of the health economic evidence, Epkinly does not represent good value to the health care system at the public list price. A price reduction is therefore required. Based on public list prices, Epkinly is estimated to cost the public drug plans approximately $44 million over the next 3 years. ADDITIONAL INFORMATION: WHAT IS R/R DLBCL? Non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) is a type of cancer that forms in the lymphatic system. DLBCL is an aggressive type of NHL that accounts for 30% to 40% of NHL cases in Canada. DLBCL occurs when a type of white blood cell, called a B-cell, grows or divides abnormally, which causes tumours in the lymph nodes or other organs, including the spleen, liver, or bone marrow. r/r DLBCL is cancer that has come back after treatment (relapsed) or has not responded to certain treatments (refractory). UNMET NEEDS IN R/R DLBCL: Not all patients with DLBCL respond to or are cured by first-line treatment with the combination chemotherapy treatment of rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin hydrochloride (hydroxydaunorubicin), vincristine sulphate, and prednisone (R-CHOP). Approximately 30% to 50% of patients will experience disease progression or relapse within the first 2 years following R-CHOP therapy and will require additional treatments for their disease. There is also a need for accessible treatments for patients who progress after CAR T-cell therapy or for those who cannot receive CAR T-cell therapy. HOW MUCH DOES EPKINLY COST? Treatment with Epkinly is expected to cost approximately $14,320 in cycle 1, $26,436 in each of cycles 2 and 3, $13,218 in each of cycles 4 to 9, and $6,609 in each of cycles 10 and beyond. Costs are reported per patient."

Treatment in group A consisted of six alternating cycles of R-CHOP (intravenous rituximab 375 mg/m(2) on day 0 or 1, intravenous cyclophosphamide 750 mg/m(2) on day 1, intravenous doxorubicin 50 mg/m(2) on day 1, intravenous vincristine 1.4 mg/m(2) on day 1, and oral prednisone 100 mg on days 1-5) and R-DHAP (or R-DHAOx, intravenous rituximab 375 mg/m(2) on day 0 or 1, intravenous or oral dexamethasone 40 mg on days 1-4, intravenous cytarabine 2 x 2 g/m(2) for 3 h every 12 h on day 2, and intravenous cisplatin 100 mg/m(2) over 24 h on day 1 or alternatively intravenous oxaliplatin 130 mg/m(2) on day 1) followed by ASCT. In group A+I, ibrutinib (560 mg orally each day) was added on days 1-19 of R-CHOP cycles and as fixed-duration maintenance (560 mg orally each day for 2 years) after ASCT. In group I, ibrutinib was given the same way as in group A+I, but ASCT was omitted. Three pairwise one-sided log-rank tests for the primary outcome of failure-free survival were statistically monitored. The primary analysis was done by intention-to-treat. Adverse events were evaluated by treatment period among patients who started the respective treatment. This ongoing trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02858258. FINDINGS: Between July 29, 2016 and Dec 28, 2020, 870 patients (662 men, 208 women) were randomly assigned to group A (n=288), group A+I (n=292), and group I (n=290). After 31 months median follow-up, group A+I was superior to group A with 3-year failure-free survival of 88% (95% CI 84-92) versus 72% (67-79; hazard ratio 0.52 [one-sided 98.3% CI 0-0.86]; one-sided p=0.0008). Superiority of group A over group I was not shown with 3-year failure-free survival 72% (67-79) versus 86% (82-91; hazard ratio 1.77 [one-sided 98.3% CI 0-3.76]; one-sided p=0.9979). The comparison of group A+I versus group I is ongoing. There were no relevant differences in grade 3-5 adverse events during induction or ASCT between patients treated with R-CHOP/R-DHAP or ibrutinib combined with R-CHOP/R-DHAP. During maintenance or follow-up, substantially more grade 3-5 haematological adverse events and infections were reported after ASCT plus ibrutinib (group A+I; haematological: 114 [50%] of 231 patients; infections: 58 [25%] of 231; fatal infections: two [1%] of 231) compared with ibrutinib only (group I; haematological: 74 [28%] of 269; infections: 52 [19%] of 269; fatal infections: two [1%] of 269) or after ASCT (group A; haematological: 51 [21%] of 238; infections: 32 [13%] of 238; fatal infections: three [1%] of 238). INTERPRETATION: Adding ibrutinib to first-line treatment resulted in superior efficacy in younger mantle cell lymphoma patients with increased toxicity when given after ASCT. Adding ibrutinib during induction and as maintenance should be part of first-line treatment of younger mantle cell lymphoma patients. Whether ASCT adds to an ibrutinib-containing regimen is not yet determined. FUNDING: Janssen and Leukemia & Lymphoma Society."

We aimed to assess the safety and activity of sintilimab plus P-GEMOX (pegaspargase, gemcitabine, and oxaliplatin) in the first-line setting for advanced ENKTL. METHODS: The multicentre, single-arm, phase 2 trial was done at three medical centres in China. Patients aged 18-75 years with treatment-naive pathologically confirmed advanced ENKTL and an with Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status score of 0-2 were eligible. Patients received intravenous sintilimab (200 mg on day 1), intramuscular pegaspargase (2000 U/m(2) on day 1), intravenous gemcitabine (1 g/m(2) on days 1 and 8), and intravenous oxaliplatin (130 mg/m(2) on day 1) every 3 weeks for six cycles, followed by intravenous sintilimab (200 mg) every 3 weeks for up to 2 years or until disease progression or unacceptable toxicities. The primary endpoint was the complete response rate in the intention-to-treat population. The secondary endpoints were overall response rate (ORR), progression-free survival (PFS), disease-free survival (DFS), and overall survival. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04127227. Enrolment has been completed, and follow-up is ongoing. FINDINGS: Between Nov 29, 2019, and Sept 7, 2022, 34 eligible patients were enrolled (median age 39 years [IQR 32-55]; 25 [74%] of 34 patients were male; nine [26%] were female; and all were of Asian ethnicity). At the data cutoff (July 20, 2023), the median follow-up was 21 months (IQR 13-32). The complete response rate was 85% (29 of 34 patients, 95% CI 70-94). Five patients (15%; 95% CI 7-30) attained partial response and the ORR was 100% (34 of 34 patients). 24-month PFS was 64% (95% CI 48-86), 24-month DFS was 72% (54-95), and 36-month overall survival was 76% (52-100). The most common grade 3 or 4 treatment-related adverse events were neutropenia (17 [50%] of 34 patients), anaemia (10 [29%] patients), and hypertriglyceridemia (10 [29%] patients). Hypothyroidism was the most frequent immune-related adverse event (18 [53%]), including grade 3 hypothyroidism in one (3%) patient that caused treatment termination. No severe adverse events occurred. There were three deaths: one due to haemophagocytic syndrome, one due to disease progression, and one due to unknown cause, which were not considered to be treatment related. INTERPRETATION: Combination of sintilimab with P-GEMOX seems to be an active and safe first-line regimen for patients with advanced ENKTL.

We aimed to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of oxaliplatin in combination with rituximab and gemcitabine and to explore the efficacy and safety of R-GemOx in relapsed or refractory (r/r) indolent and mantle cell lymphoma (MCL). In this single-arm, phase I/II trial, we enrolled 55 patients with r/r indolent lymphoma and MCL not suitable for autologous stem-cell transplantation. Patients received 4 cycles of R-GemOx. In the dose escalation group, 70 mg/m(2) of oxaliplatin was applied and interindividually increased by 10 mg/m(2) until the MTD was reached together with fixed doses of rituximab and gemcitabine. At the oxaliplatin MTD, an extension cohort was opened. Primary aim was to detect an overall response rate (ORR) greater than 65% (alpha = 0.05). Oxaliplatin 70 mg/m(2) (MTD) was chosen for the extension cohort after 3 of 6 patients experienced a DLT at 80 mg/m(2). Among 46 patients evaluable for the efficacy analysis ORR was 72% (33/46), missing the primary aim of the study (p = 0.21). After a median follow-up of 7.9 years, median PFS and OS were 1.0 and 2.1 years. Most frequent grade >/= 3 adverse events were cytopenias. R-GemOx induces decent response rates in r/r indolent lymphoma and MCL, though novel targeted therapies have largely replaced chemotherapy in the relapse setting. Particularly in MCL, R-GemOx might be an alternative option in late relapses or as bridging to CAR-T-cells. This study was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov on Aug 4th, 2009, number NCT00954005."

Nevertheless, the potential and mechanisms of ICD in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) remain inadequately studied. To address this gap, our current study aims to examine the impact of ICD on DLBCL and identify a corresponding gene signature in DLBC. Using the expression profiles of ICD-associated genes, the gene expression omnibus (GEO) samples were segregated into ICD-high and ICD-low subtypes utilizing non-negative matrix factorization clustering. Next, univariate and LASSO Cox regression analyses were employed to establish the ICD-related gene signature. Subsequently, the CIBERSORT tool, ssGSEA, and ESTIMATE algorithm were utilized to examine the association between the signature and tumor immune microenvironment of DLBC. Finally, the oncoPredict algorithm was implemented to evaluate the drug sensitivity prediction of DLBCL patients. These findings suggest that the immune microenvironment of the ICD-high group with a poor prognosis was significantly suppressed. An 8-gene ICD-related signature was identified and validated to prognosticate and evaluate the tumor immune microenvironment in DLBCL. Similarly, the high-risk group exhibited a worse prognosis compared to the low-risk group, and the immune function was considerably suppressed. Moreover, the results of oncoPredict algorithm indicated that patients in the high-risk group exhibited higher sensitivity to Cisplatin, Cytarabine, Epirubicin, Oxaliplatin, and Vincristine with low IC50. In conclusion, the present study provides novel insights into the role of ICD in DLBCL by identifying a new biomarker for the disease and may have implications for the development of immune-targeted therapies for the tumor."

PATIENTS AND METHODS: This retrospective analysis used 2014 to 2019 U.S. Medicare claims. Individuals aged >/=66 years with a new DLBCL diagnosis between October 1, 2015 and December 31, 2018 and continuous fee-for-service Medicare Part A, B, and D coverage in the 12 months pre- and postindex were followed to identify the sample of patients with evidence of R-GemOx treatment in the second-line (2L) or third-line (3L) setting. Outcomes included overall survival, all-cause and DLBCL-related HCRU, and costs after R-GemOx initiation. RESULTS: The final sample included 157 patients who received treatment with R-GemOx in the R/R settings (mean (SD) age 77.5 (6.0) years, 39.5% age>80 years; 66.9% male; 91.1% White).

Nonetheless, ctDNA testing is rarely utilized for patients with newly diagnosed metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC). We report a case in which ctDNA testing uncovered an actionable biomarker that was not detected by comprehensive genomic profiling of tumor tissue. An 81-year-old woman with a remote history of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma presented with primary masses in the ascending colon and sigmoid colon. The ascending colon and sigmoid colon tumors were classified as microsatellite stable (MSS) and mismatch repair proficient (pMMR), and both ctDNA and tissue next-generation sequencing (NGS) from the ascending colon mass were ordered. Because tissue NGS results indicated that the ascending colon tumor was MSS, palliative 5-fluorouracil, leucovorin, and oxaliplatin (FOLFOX) chemotherapy was started. However, the ctDNA NGS results that arrived after the start of FOLFOX found high microsatellite instability (MSI-H) and mismatch repair deficiency (dMMR) disease with a serine/threonine-protein kinase B-Raf (BRAF (V600E) ) mutation. To treat both her MSS/pMMR ascending colon and sigmoid colon tumors and MSI-H/dMMR metastatic disease, the immunotherapy nivolumab was added to FOLFOX. After 8 months of combined nivolumab and chemotherapy, the patient's metastatic disease had a complete clinical response. This case highlights the complementary role of ctDNA testing for biomarker identification. By performing simultaneous ctDNA testing at the time of diagnosis, an actionable biomarker was discovered that significantly altered this patient's prognosis and treatment options. Orthogonal testing of key molecular alterations offers significant advantages for identifying actionable biomarkers and improving management of metastatic CRC."

The study reported 2 ENKTL-related HLH patients. PATIENT CONCERNS: Patient 1 visited for nasal congestion and runny nose for 6 months then got a fever and serious myelosuppression after P-GEP (pegaspargase, gemcitabine, etoposide, and methylprednisolone) chemotherapy. Patient 2 complained of painless lymphadenectasis in the right neck for 4 months and experienced recurrent fever and poor performance status after 3 cycles of P-Gemox (pegaspargase, gemcitabine, and oxaliplatin) chemotherapy. DIAGNOSES: Patient 1 and patient 2 were diagnosed as ENKTL failing in asparaginase-based chemotherapy and involving secondary HLH. INTERVENTIONS: The dose of chidamide was 20 mg twice a week for 2 weeks and sintilimab was 200 mg once every 3 weeks. OUTCOMES: ENKTL was relieved and the HLH was resolved after the therapy of sintilimab and chidamide. The patients had achieved durable survival without immune-related adverse events. LESSONS: ENKTL-related HLH needs early diagnosis and treatment. The combined strategy of sintilimab plus chidamide help deal with HLH and solve ENKTL, it may be a useful treatment option for ENKTL-related HLH."

It can exhibit diverse extranodal manifestations. However, renal involvement is uncommon, and if it occurs, it usually only gets detected postmortem. There are several mechanisms by which mantle cell lymphoma can damage the kidneys. Renal failure is a potential complication, and prompt evaluation and diagnosis are critical steps to prevent long-term complications. CASE PRESENTATION: We present the case of a 75-year-old non-Hispanic White male with past medical history significant for hypertension and dyslipidemia, presenting with fever, weight loss, and night sweats. Work-up showed markedly elevated white blood cells, multiple enlarged lymph nodes, and a kidney mass. The patient was diagnosed with mantle cell lymphoma with kidney involvement confirmed with a kidney biopsy. His disease was positive for cyclin D1 overexpression despite t(11; 14) absence. The patient received six cycles of alternating vincristine, rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and prednisone then dexamethasone, high-dose cytarabine, and oxaliplatin, after which he was maintained on ibrutinib and rituximab, with resolution of symptoms and disease regression. CONCLUSION: We present a case of a rare presentation of Mantle cell lymphoma while describing the clinical presentation and diagnostic and treatment approaches. This case report can assist physicians in the clinical work-up and treatment of patients with similar diagnosis or presentation."

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Data were collected from health records of eligible patients aged >/=18 years with histologically confirmed DLBCL who had received >/=2 systemic therapies for DLBCL (including >/=1 anti-CD20 therapy). Patients from L-MIND were matched with patients from the RE-MIND2 observational cohort using estimated propensity score-based 1:1 nearest-neighbor matching, balanced for nine covariates. The primary analysis compared tafasitamab plus lenalidomide with patients who received any systemic therapy for R/R DLBCL (pooled in one cohort) or bendamustine plus rituximab (BR) or rituximab plus gemcitabine and oxaliplatin (R-GemOx; as two distinct cohorts). The primary endpoint was overall survival (OS). Secondary endpoints included treatment response and time-to-event outcomes. RESULTS: In RE-MIND2, 3,454 patients were enrolled from 200 sites in North America, Europe, and Asia-Pacific. Strictly matched pairs of patients consisted of tafasitamab plus lenalidomide versus systemic therapies pooled (n = 76 pairs), versus BR (n = 75 pairs), and versus R-GemOx (n = 74 pairs). Significantly prolonged OS was reported with tafasitamab plus lenalidomide versus systemic pooled therapies [hazard ratios (HR): 0.55; P = 0.0068], BR (HR: 0.42; P < 0.0001), and R-GemOx (HR: 0.47; P = 0.0003). CONCLUSIONS: RE-MIND2, a retrospective observational study, met its primary endpoint, demonstrating prolonged OS with tafasitamab plus lenalidomide versus BR and R-GemOx.

Gemcitabine, oxaliplatin, and L-asparaginase (GELOX) is one of the first-line chemotherapy regimens of NKTCL. Yet, the prognosis of NKTCL is poor. Icaritin is an herb-derived monomer from icariin with antitumor effects. We found that icaritin induced proliferation inhibition and apoptosis of NKTCL both in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, icaritin inhibited the dissemination of NKTCL in vivo. RNA sequencing revealed the Polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1) gene and DNA damage response (DDR) as the targets of icaritin. Mechanistically, icaritin inhibited PLK1 to promote checkpoint kinase 2 (Chk2) homodimerization and its T387 phosphorylation, which further activated p53, leading to the activation of the DDR pathway. Moreover, inhibiting PLK1 increased Forkhead box O3a nuclear localization, the latter of which activated ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM), an early sensor of DNA damage. Then ATM phosphorylated Chk2 T68 and initiated Chk2 activation. Remarkably, the combined treatment of icaritin and GELOX achieved better antitumor efficacy than single treatment in vivo. In summary, our results proved the efficacy of icaritin treating NKTCL, provided insights into its antitumor molecular mechanism, and revealed the application value of icaritin in facilitating clinical NKTCL treatment."

The Bruton tyrosine kinase inhibitor ibrutinib, given as monotherapy or combined with other molecules, has proven effective in numerous B-cell lymphomas. To evaluate the safety of the combination of ibrutinib, rituximab, dexamethasone, and cytarabine with either cisplatin (R-DHAP) or oxaliplatin (R-DHAOx), we conducted a multicenter Phase 1b-II study in transplant-eligible R/R B-NHL patients, with ibrutinib given using a 3-by-3 dose-escalation design. The combination of R-DHAP and ibrutinib (given from Day 1 to Day 21 of each cycle) was associated with dose-limiting hematological, infectious, and renal toxicities, while we were unable to reach a dose to recommend for Phase II. R-DHAOx could only be combined with a daily dosage of 280 mg ibrutinib when administered continuously. R-DHAP combined with intermittent ibrutinib administration (from Day 5 to Day 18) was found to be highly toxic. On the other hand, when this administration schedule was combined with R-DHAOx, ibrutinib dosing could be increased up to 560 mg but with relevant toxicities. Despite a strong rationale for combining ibrutinib and R-DHAP/R-DHAOx, as both target lymphoma B-cells by different mechanisms, this approach was limited by significant toxicities."

This study investigates the relative efficacy of TAFA + LEN versus comparator treatments. METHODS: Matching-adjusted indirect comparisons (MAICs) of TAFA + LEN were performed using data from L-MIND, and comparator studies assessing rituximab-based combination therapies, including polatuzumab vedotin + bendamustine + rituximab (POLA + BR) bendamustine + rituximab (BR), and gemcitabine + oxaliplatin + rituximab (R-GEMOX) to provide relative efficacy estimates for overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), duration of response (DOR), objective response rate (ORR), and complete response rate (CRR). Patient-level data from L-MIND were weighted to match reported distributions of clinically validated prognostic factors and effect modifiers in comparator trials. MAIC results versus multiple BR studies were pooled using meta-analysis. RESULTS: MAICs were feasible versus POLA + BR and BR. Compared to POLA + BR, TAFA + LEN was associated with significantly longer DOR [hazard ratio (HR) 0.34 (95% CI 0.12, 0.98); p = 0.045]. Due to concerns about the proportional hazard assumption for OS and PFS, separate HRs were estimated before and after 4 months of follow-up. OS after 4 months, was significantly greater for TAFA + LEN versus POLA + BR [HR 0.41 (95% CI 0.19, 0.90); p = 0.026]. Compared with BR, TAFA + LEN was associated with significantly improved OS [GO29365 comparator trial: HR 0.39 (95% CI 0.18, 0.82); p = 0.014], PFS (pooled data: HR 0.39 (95% CI 0.29, 0.53); p < 0.001], DOR [pooled data: HR 0.35 (95% CI 0.25, 0.50); p < 0.001], and CRR [pooled data: odds ratio 2.43 (95% CI 1.33, 4.41); p = 0.004]. CONCLUSION: In MAIC analyses, treatment with TAFA + LEN for R/R DLBCL provided better OS and PFS outcomes than standard treatment regimens. Validation from large, randomized, phase 3 clinical trials is required to confirm these results."

METHODS: Adult patients with >/=2 LBCL diagnoses between January 1, 2012, and March 31, 2019, were identified (index date was the date of the earliest LBCL diagnosis) from MarketScan(R) Commercial and Medicare Supplemental Databases. Patients had >/=1 claim for any LBCL treatment, >/=6 months of data before (baseline) and >/=12 months of data after (follow-up period) the index date, and no baseline LBCL diagnosis. Treatment patterns, adverse events, and all-cause and LBCL-related health care resource utilization and costs were examined. All patients had received first-line therapy of cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone with or without rituximab; etoposide, prednisone, vincristine, cyclophosphamide, and doxorubicin hydrochloride with or without rituximab; or regimens with anthracycline and second-line therapy with stem cell transplant (SCT)-intended intensive therapy or platinum-based chemotherapy. Patients who received an SCT-intended second-line regimen or received an SCT regardless of second-line regimen were considered SCT eligible. FINDINGS: A total of 188 patients met the criteria of eligibility for SCT. Among the 119 patients who received a second-line regimen intended for SCT, only 22.7% received an SCT. Patients eligible for SCT started first-line therapy within 1 month of their LBCL index date, and the mean duration of first-line therapy was 4.1 months. The mean gap in therapy between first- and second-line therapy was 6.6 months, and the mean duration of second-line therapy was 3.0 months. During the second-line therapy treatment window (mean duration with SCT, 12.4 months; mean duration without SCT, 4.8 months), the most common regimens for patients eligible for SCT were ifosfamide, carboplatin, and etoposide with or without rituximab and gemcitabine and oxaliplatin with or without rituximab; the top 4 most common treatment-related adverse events were febrile neutropenia (56.4%), anemia (49.5%), thrombocytopenia (42.6%), and nausea and vomiting (36.2%), which were similar regardless of receipt of SCT; mean (SD) per-patient-per-month all-cause costs were $46,174 ($49,057) for patients with SCT and $45,780 ($52,813) for patients without SCT. IMPLICATIONS: Treatment patterns among patients with relapsed or refractory LBCL eligible for SCT were highly varied. Only 22.7% of patients who received an SCT-preparative regimen ultimately received SCT, which highlights the magnitude of unmet needs in this population. The occurrence of treatment-related adverse events was similar regardless of SCT status. Per-patient-per-month all-cause costs were also similar with upfront SCT costs averaged during a longer follow-up."

The main dose-limiting toxicities of oxaliplatin are hematological toxicity and peripheral sensory neuropathy. CASE REPORT: A 42-year-old man with refractory peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PTCL) was admitted to receive GEMOX chemotherapy regimen (gemcitabine, oxaliplatin). Three days after receiving his third cycle of chemotherapy regimen, he was re-admitted to the emergency department with complaint of severe generalized weakness, and paraplegia in the lower extremities. According to clinical and para-clinical findings, chronic sensorimotor polyneuropathy with ongoing axonal loss was confirmed. MANAGEMENT & OUTCOME: Intravenous dexamethasone 8 mg three times daily was started at the time of admission for the patient. Muscle weakness and sensory impairment improved dramatically within 10 days and the patient was able to walk with assistance. DISCUSSION: Several cases of neuropathy following oxaliplatin and only one case with gemcitabine-based chemotherapy regimen have been previously reported. However, motor symptoms are rare unless in the setting of acute neuropathy due to oxaliplatin. The most striking finding of our study was the incidence of a chronic sensorimotor axonaldemyelinating polyneuropathy in a patient who were subjected to oxaliplatin therapy.

This study reports the efficacy and toxicity of sequential P-GEMOX (pegaspargase, gemcitabine and oxaliplatin) and radiotherapy in a large Chinese cohort comprising of 202 patients diagnosed with early-stage ENKTL from six medical centers. The observed best overall response rate was 96.0% and 168 (83.2%) patients achieved complete remission. With a median follow-up of 44.1 months, the 3-year progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were 74.6% and 85.2%, respectively. Multivariate analysis suggested that extensive primary tumor (PFS, hazard ratio [HR] 3.660, 95% CI 1.820-7.359, p <  0.001; OS, HR 3.825, 95% CI 1.442-10.148, p = 0.007) and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status >/= 2 (PFS, 3.042, 95% CI 1.468-6.306, p = 0.003; OS, HR 3.983, 95% CI 1.678-9.457, p = 0.02) were independent prognostic factors for survival outcomes. Among the established prognostic models for ENKTL, the nomogram-revised risk index model had optimal prognostic risk stratification ability (PFS, p < 0.001; OS, p < 0.001) and relatively balanced population distribution. The adverse events of this CMT were well-tolerated and manageable. In conclusion, sequential P-GEMOX and radiotherapy showed favorable efficacy with acceptable toxicity, and could be an effective treatment option for early-stage ENKTL patients."

In recent years, programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1)/programmed cell - ligand 1 pathway blockade and histone deacetylase inhibitors have emerged as promising strategies for refractory or relapsed ENKTL. Accumulating evidence has shown that therapeutic effects of anti-PD-1 antibody could be enhanced by histone deacetylase inhibitors. PATIENT CONCERNS: A 52-year-old male patient was diagnosed with stage I ENKTL by biopsy on February 2010. DIAGNOSIS: positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT) and biopsy were used to diagnose relapsed ENKTL in 2014. INTERVENTIONS: The patient was treated with radiotherapy and six cycles of etoposide, prednisone, vincristine (Oncovin), cyclophosphamide and doxorubicin hydrochloride and achieved complete remission (CR) by PET-CT in August 2010. In November 2014, the patient was diagnosed with relapsed stage IV ENKTL and was treated with six cycles of alternative chemotherapy with the regimen of steroid (dexamethasone), methotrexate, ifosfamide, L-asparaginase, and etoposide and pegaspargase plus Gemcitabine, Oxaliplatin along with radiotherapy. The patient achieved remission and was placed on thalidomide maintenance treatment. Upon suspicion of relapse suggested by PET-CT, Autologous stem cell transplant was performed after BCNU, etoposide, Ara-C, and melphalan preconditioning on February 2016. Following relapse again in December 2016, the lesions of left femur were treated with radiotherapy and he received anti-PD-1 antibody. He was treated with 4 cycles of pegaspargase plus Gemcitabine, Oxaliplatin on August 2017. The patient's condition improved. He received maintenance and consolidation therapy including lenalidomide, radiotherapy of the right nasal cavity and paranasal sinuses and antigen-specific reactive T cell infusions. PET-CT imaging showed there was high metabolic activity signal in the distal end of right femoral on August 2018 and the treatment regimen was adjusted to radiotherapy of the distal end of right femoral and systemic treatment of PD-1 antibody Sintilimab and chidamide 30 mg. After 5 months post-treatment, biopsy of nasopharynx showed no lymphoma cells. The patient continued the treatment of Sintilimab and chidamide 20 mg. OUTCOMES: PET-CT imaging showed his lesions obtained remission after 8 months post-treatment. CONCLUSION: Thus, combination of sintilimab and chidamide can be used to treat relapsed ENKTL following treatment failure from chemo-, radio-, and immuno-therapy. A clinical trial has been launched."

Induction consisted of four courses of R-DHAP (rituximab, dexamethasone, high-dose cytarabine, and platinum derivative). The platinum derivative (PD) choice was free: R-DHA-cisplatin, R-DHA-carboplatin, or R-DHA-oxaliplatin. We investigated the prognostic impact of each PD. PFS and OS calculated from inclusion and investigated in an intention-to-treat (ITT) (= 298) and per-protocol analyses (PP) (n = 227). R-DHACis, R-DHACa, or R-DHAOx were used at first cycle in 184, 76, and 38 patients, respectively. Overall, 71 patients (59 in the R-DHACis) required a change in PD, mainly because of PD toxicity. In ITT-analysis, PFS in the R-DHACis and R-DHACa groups were similar (4-year PFS of 65%), while R-DHAOx had a better PFS (4-year PFS of 65% versus 86.5%, respectively, HR = 0.44, p = 0.02). The 4-year OS was 92% for R-DHAOx versus 75.9% for R-DHACis/DHACa (HR = 0.37, p = 0.03). Similar results were yielded in the PP analysis. Low MIPI and R-DHAOx were independent favorable prognostic markers for both PFS (HR = 0.44, p = 0.035) and OS (HR = 0.36, p = 0.045). In vitro and in silico analyses confirmed that oxaliplatin has an anti-MCL cytotoxic effect that differs from that of other PD. R-DHAOx before ASCT provides better outcome in transplantation eligible young MCL patients."

This study aimed to investigate the clinical features, treatment strategy and survival outcome in patients with advanced stage ENKTL. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 107 patients with newly diagnosed advanced stage ENKTL between January 2010 and December 2014 were reviewed from three cancer centers. Survival probability was calculated using Kaplan-Meier and the survival curves were compared by Log rank test. Cox regression analyses was performed to investigate the prognostic factors in ENKTL. RESULTS: The median patient age in our cohort was 42.0 years, with a male to female ratio of around 2.3:1. Over half of the patients had B symptoms (n = 61), high IPI scores (>/= 2, n = 60) and high Prognostic Index of Natural Killer Lymphoma (PINK) scores (>/= 3, n = 69). Elevated LDH level was present in around half of the patients (44/91). Most patients (n = 88) in our cohort originated in upper aerodigestive tract and the remaining 19 cases presented with non-upper aerodigestive tract involvement at first diagnosis. Chemotherapy regimens used in our study mainly include CHOP (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone) (n = 26), L-asparaginase (L-asp) containing chemotherapy (GELOXD (gemcitabine, l-asparaginase, oxaliplatin and dexamethasone) and SMILE (L-asparaginase, methotrexate, ifosfamide, etoposide, and dexamethasone)) (n = 66). No significant difference between the baseline clinical characteristics was found between the L-asp and CHOP group. The CR rate after treatment was 39.3% (42/107) for the whole cohort. The 3-year progression-free survival (PFS) and 3-year overall survival (OS) rate was 41.0% and 41.5%, respectively. The 3-year PFS (49.2% vs 26.5%, P = 0.048) and 3-year OS (49.4% vs 26.0%, P = 0.030) was significantly higher in the L-asp group than the CHOP group. Patient CR status and PINK score were proved to be significant independent factors affecting OS and PFS by multivariate analysis. The grade 3/4 hematologic toxicity (P = 0.0003) and non-hematologic toxicity (P = 0.0002) occurred more frequently in the SMILE group than the GELOXD group. CONCLUSION: Our results demonstrated that L-asp containing chemotherapy could provide favorable survival outcomes in patients with advanced stage ENKTL."

Nine patients underwent six 21-day cycles of anti-PD-1 antibody (day 1), pegaspargase 2000 U/m(2) (day 1), gemcitabine 1 g/m(2) (days 1 and 8) and oxaliplatin 130 mg/m(2) (day 1), followed by anti-PD-1 antibody maintenance every 3 weeks. Programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression and genetic alterations were determined in paraffin-embedded pretreatment tissue samples using immunohistochemistry and next-generation sequencing (NGS) analysis. Responses were assessed using (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography ((18)FDG-PET) and computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging. Eight patients exhibited significant responses, comprising of seven complete remissions and one partial remission (overall response rate: 88.9%). After a median follow-up of 10.6 months, 6/9 patients (66.7%) remained in complete remission. The most common grade 3/4 adverse events were anemia (33.3%), neutropenia (33.3%), and thrombocytopenia (33.3%); all of which were manageable and resolved. Immunochemotherapy produced a high response rate in patients with positive PD-L1 expression (5/6, 83.3%). NGS analysis suggested that STAT3/JAK3/PD-L1 alterations and ARID1A mutation were associated with immunochemotherapy efficacy. Mutation in DDX3X and alteration in epigenetic modifiers of KMT2D, TET2, and BCORL1 might indicate a poor response to immunochemotherapy. In conclusion, the anti-PD-1 antibody plus P-GEMOX regimen demonstrated promising efficacy in advanced NKTL. PD-L1 expression combined with specific genetic alterations could be used as potential biomarkers to predict therapeutic responses to immunochemotherapy."

The present study demonstrated a significant synergistic effect of PD-1 inhibitor and oxaliplatin, cisplatin, etoposide, cytarabine, ifosfamide and carboplatin. There was no difference in cytotoxicity between the groups with or without PD-L1 inhibitor. It was also observed that cytotoxicity of T cells combined with PD-1 inhibitor against DLBCL cells was inhibited by dexamethasone addition to the culture system at 24, 48 and 72 h.

We aimed to investigate the activity of obinutuzumab plus DHAP (dexamethasone, high-dose cytarabine, and cisplatin), measured by minimal residual disease quantitative (q)PCR status in the bone marrow after four cycles. METHODS: LyMa-101 was a prospective, open-label, single-arm, phase 2 trial. Participants were enrolled from 28 hospitals in France. Newly diagnosed patients with mantle cell lymphoma (aged 18 to <66 years) who were eligible for autologous stem-cell transplantation received four cycles of obinutuzumab plus DHAP (obinutuzumab 1000 mg/m(2) intravenously on days 1, 8, and 15 at cycle 1 and day 1 at cycles 2, 3, and 4; dexamethasone 40 mg intravenously on days 1-4, cytarabine 2 g/m(2) intravenously every 12 h on day 1, and according to local investigator, cisplatin 100 mg/m(2) by continuous infusion over 24 h on day 1 or carboplatin area under the curve 5 or oxaliplatin 130 mg/m(2)) every 21 days before transplantation, and 3 years of obinutuzumab (1000 mg/m(2) every 2 months) maintenance followed by minimal residual disease-based obinutuzumab on-demand maintenance. The primary outcome was minimal residual disease negativity in the bone marrow after four cycles of obinutuzumab plus DHAP at the end of induction, measured in the efficacy set (all minimal residual disease-informative [bone marrow or peripheral blood] patients who received at least one dose of obinutuzumab). Obinutuzumab plus DHAP was considered effective if bone marrow minimal residual disease negativity was 70% or more by intention to treat. The trial is closed to recruitment and registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02896582. FINDINGS: 86 patients were enrolled between Nov 29, 2016, and May 2, 2018. 81 patients completed induction, 73 underwent autologous stem-cell transplantation, and 69 started maintenance therapy. 55 (75%) of 73 patients in the efficacy set reached minimal residual disease negativity in bone marrow at end of induction. According to the protocol definition, 18 (25%) of 73 patients in the efficacy set were minimal residual disease-positive: 12 patients who were minimal residual disease-positive in the bone marrow, plus two patients who progressed during induction, and four patients who did not have minimal residual disease assessment. The most common grade 3-4 treatment-emergent adverse events were anaemia (grade 3, 26 [31%] of 85 patients; grade 4, three [4%] of 85 patients) and neutropenia (grade 3, 13 [15%] of 85 patients; grade 4, 32 [38%] of 85 patients). 58 serious adverse events occurred during the induction phase. There were no treatment-related deaths. INTERPRETATION: Obinutuzumab plus DHAP is a well tolerated regimen and has good activity for inducing minimal residual disease negativity in the bone marrow of transplant-eligible patients with mantle cell lymphoma. Obinutuzumab plus DHAP has potential activity as induction chemotherapy, with bone marrow minimal residual disease negativity potentially predicting long-term disease control. FUNDING: Roche SAS."

Methods: From April 2015 to July 2018, 103 patients with ND-ENKTL were randomly assigned to SVILE (experimental group) or P-GemOx (control group) chemotherapy followed by radiotherapy and consolidation chemotherapy. The primary endpoint was the overall response rate after 3 cycles of chemotherapy, and secondary study endpoints were complete response (CR), progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS). Safety was also evaluated. Results: There were no significant differences in baseline characteristics in the experimental vs. control groups. In experimental and control groups, respectively, the overall response rates were 91.7% vs. 97.0% for stage I/II and 75.0% vs. 72.2% for stage III/IV. The CR rates were 83.4% vs. 97.0% for stage I/II and 68.8% vs. 61.1% for stage III/IV. None of those differences were significant. There was no significant difference in PFS and OS between groups and between patients in stage I/II and stage III/IV. The 3-year PFS and OS in stage I/II were 88.3% vs. 93.3% and 88.8% vs. 97.0%, respectively. The 3-year PFS and OS in stage III/IV were 46.2% vs. 65.7% and 68.8% vs. 72.2%, respectively. The common adverse events were hematological toxicity, hepatotoxicity, and coagulation abnormalities, which were found to be reversible with supportive therapy. Conclusions: The novel SVILE regimen has comparable effects to those of P-GemOx in patients with ND-ENKTL and is well tolerated. SVILE is a therapeutic option for ND-ENKTL."

Here, we evaluated SAMHD1 as potential biomarker for the response to high-dose cytarabine in mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) patients. We quantified SAMHD1 protein expression and determined the mutation status in patients of the MCL Younger and Elderly trials (n = 189), who had received high-dose cytarabine- or fludarabine-based polychemotherapy. Additionally, we quantified SAMHD1 expression in B cell lymphoma cell lines and exposed them to cytarabine, fludarabine, and clinically relevant combinations. Across both trials investigated, SAMHD1 mutations had a frequency of 7.1% (n = 13) and did not significantly affect the failure-free survival (FFS, P = .47). In patients treated with high-dose cytarabine- or fludarabine-containing regimes, SAMHD1 expression was not significantly associated with FFS or complete remission rate. SAMHD1 expression in B cell lymphoma cell lines, however, inversely correlated with their in vitro response to cytarabine as single agent (R = .65, P = .0065). This correlation could be reversed by combining cytarabine with other chemotherapeutics, such as oxaliplatin and vincristine, similar to the treatment regime of the MCL Younger trial. We conclude that this might explain why we did not observe a significant association between SAMHD1 protein expression and the outcome of MCL patients upon cytarabine-based treatment."

R-CHOP-like regimens allow to achieve high response rate, but the overall survival (OS) are disappointingly short - 3-4 years. An addition of high - dose cytarabine to the upfront therapy and autoSCT significantly improved outcomes but remain feasible largely for medically fit patients. Based on the activity and good tolerance of gemcitabine - oxaliplatin schemes in relapsed and refractory MCL patients, we developed an alternative first - line course for patients who are not eligible for R-HD-MTX-AraC. AIM: Assess toxicity and efficacy of R-DA-EPOCH/ R-HD-MTX-AraC and R-DA-EPOCH/R-GIDIOX schemes, autoSCT and R-maintenance in untreated MCL patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 47 untreated MCL patients from 6 centers were enrolled in prospective study between April 2008 and September 2013. All patients have stage II-V; ECOG 0-3; median age 55 years (29-64); Male/Female 76%/24%. MIPIb: 28% low, 33% intermediate and 39% high risk. Following 1st R-EPOCH patients were assigned to receive either R-DA-EPOCH/ R-HD-MTX-AraC or R-DA-EPOCH/ R-GIDIOX regimen. In the absence of renal failure, hematological toxicity grade 4 more than 3 days and severe infections patients received R-HD-MTX-AraC scheme (R 375 mg/m2 Day 0, Methotrexate 1000 mg/m2/24 hours Day 1, AraC 3000 mg/m2 q 12 hrs Days 2-3). Patients who had at least one of these complications received R-GIDIOX scheme (R 375 mg/m2 day 0, gemcitabine 800 mg/m2 days 1 and 4, ifosfamide 1000 mg/m2 days 1-5, dexamethasone 10 mg/m2 IV days 1-5, irinotecan 100 mg/m2 day 3, oxaliplatin 120 mg/m2 day 2). Subsequently these courses were alternating with R-DA-EPOCH in each arm of the protocol. Depending on the time of achieving CR patients received 6 or 8 courses, unless they progressed on therapy. Those patients who achieved PR/CR/CRu underwent autoSCT (BEAM-R). Post - transplant R-maintenance was administered for 3 years (R - 375 mg/m2 every 3 months). RESULTS: 29/47 patients were treated on R-HD-MTX-AraC arm (median 50 years; MIPIb: 35.7% low, 28.6% intermediate, 35.7% high risk) and 18/47 patients were on R-GIDIOX arm (median 60 years; MIPIb: 16.7% low, 38.9% intermediate, 44.4% high risk). In R-HD-MTX-AraC arm CR rate was 96.5%. In R-GIDIOX arm OR and CR rates were 94.4% and 77.7% respectively. Main hematological toxicity of R-GIDIOX was leukopenia gr. 4 occurred in 74.1%. With median follow - up of 76 months, the estimated 7-years OS and EFS in R-HD-MTX-AraC arm are 76% and 57% respectively. In R-GIDIOX arm the estimated 7-years OS and EFS are 59% and 44%, respectively. There are no statistical differences in EFS (p=0.47) and OS (p=0.06) between two arms. CONCLUSIONS: The use of a risk - adapted strategy allowed 95.7% of patients achieve PR/CR/CRu, performed autoSCT and begun R-maintenance therapy with rituximab. None of the patients needed a premature discontinuation of therapy because of unacceptable toxicity. The performance of autoSCT and R-maintenance apparently allowed to partially offset differences in the intensity of induction therapy and to maintain comparable results of therapy in both induction arms."

METHODS: A total of 68 patients with NHL admitted to the hospitals of the authors from February 2013 to April 2016 were equally distributed into the GEMOX Group (treated with Gemcitabine and Oxaliplatin) and the GDP Group (treated with Gemcitabine, Cisplatin, and Dexamethasone), with cycle repetition every 3 weeks. The efficacy was analyzed every two weeks. The side effects were analyzed once a week. Comparison of survival was performed using Kaplan-Meier method and log-rank test and Cox univariate and multivariate regression analyses. RESULTS: Efficacy in the two groups was not statistically different (p>0.05). The incidence of III-IV grade of nausea and vomiting in the GDP Group was higher than in the GEMOX Group (p<0.05). The overall incidence decreased hemoglobin, nausea and vomiting, and renal dysfunction of the GDP Group was also higher than in the GEMOX Group (p<0.05). Analysis by multivariate Cox model found that the clinical classification and the grade of malignancy were independent prognostic factors (p<0.05). The odds ratio (OR) values of the clinical classification in the GEMOX Group and the GDP Group were 2.874 and 24.074, respectively. The OR values of the grade of malignancy in the GEMOX Group and the GDP Group were 14.034 and 6.873, respectively. CONCLUSION: Both the GEMOX regimen and the GDP regimen had good short-term efficacy on NHL patients, but the GEMOX regimen is to be preferred since as it had fewer side effects than the GDP regimen."

Despite scarce data, cisplatin is frequently substituted with oxaliplatin (R-DHAOx) to avoid nephrotoxicity. We compared nephrotoxicity of cisplatin and oxaliplatin based on creatinine-based trajectory modeling. METHODS: All patients with NHL treated by R-DHAP or R-DHAOx in Angers hospital between January 01, 2007, and December 31, 2014, were included. Patients received cisplatin 100 mg/m(2) or oxaliplatin 130 mg/m(2) (d1) with cytarabine (2000 mg/m(2) , two doses, d2), dexamethasone (40 mg, d1-4), and rituximab (375 mg/m(2) , d1). Creatinine levels were recorded before each cycle. Individual profiles of trajectories were clustered to detect homogeneous patterns of evolution. RESULTS: Twenty-two patients received R-DHAP, 35 R-DHAOx, 6 switched from R-DHAP to R-DHAOx due to nephrotoxicity. Characteristics of patients were similar between two groups. Patients receiving R-DHAP experienced more severe renal injury than patients receiving R-DHAOx (68% vs. 7.7%, P < .001). Two homogeneous clusters appeared: cluster A, with a majority of R-DHAOx (32, 91.4%), was less nephrotoxic than B, with a majority of R-DHAP (19, 86.4%), with a decreased average serum creatinine level (P < .0001). There were no other differences between clusters. CONCLUSIONS: Our study confirms that R-DHAOx regimen causes less nephrotoxicity than R-DHAP regimen."

Clinical characteristics of the disease are not obvious and easily misdiagnosed. In this case report, we describe a patient with PI-ENKTCL who presented with intermittent hematochezia. The advantages of positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET-CT) as a useful diagnostic tool and the role of surgery as an important therapy are highlighted. CASE SUMMARY: A 45-year-old man, hospitalized due to intermittent hematochezia, underwent gastroscopy, colonoscopy, biopsy and CT, but no cause was found. Hence, we carried out a multidisciplinary team (MDT) discussion on the causes and treatment of this patient, and it was decided to perform PET-CT imaging with a MDT discussion of the results. PET-CT demonstrated a diagnosis of lymphoma and it was decided to surgically resect the lesion, and a R0 resection was successfully performed. Postoperative pathology showed negative resection margins, and examination of the lesion confirmed the diagnosis of PI-ENKTCL. After surgery, the patient underwent a follow-up period of 6 mo and received 6 cycles of gemcitabine, oxaliplatin and L-asparaginase. No recurrence or metastasis occurred. CONCLUSION: PI-ENKTCL is rare, and MDT discussion is required during diagnosis. PET-CT can be performed for imaging diagnosis. Treatment is based on surgical resection, and the best treatment regimen is determined according to postoperative pathological results to improve prognosis and to extend survival in patients."

Erythroderma associated with palmoplantar keratoderma and lymphadenopathy is the usual clinical presentation, but the disease has potentially confusing polymorphic clinical features. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We report the case of a 27-year-old patient with no notable disease history, presenting generalized non-pruritic dermatosis for 3 months, with erythema and papules, and follicular distribution, localized to the limbs, the trunk and the face. Palmoplantar keratoderma was associated with acral edema. The clinical presentation was initially evocative of pityriasis rubra pilaris. Laboratory tests showed hyperlymphocytosis with Sezary cells in the blood. A diagnosis of grade IVA Sezary syndrome was made based on the skin biopsy results and the PET scan. Screening for KIR3DL2 on T-cells in blood was positive. Extracorporeal photochemotherapy was initiated but cutaneous relapse occurred, leading to combined treatment with bexarotene, which proved ineffictive. Despite numerous chemotherapies (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, etoposide and prednisone, then dexamethasone, oxaliplatin and cytarabine, associated with brentuximab, vedotin, and, ultimately, clofarabine and endoxan), the patient died after 9 months. DISCUSSION: Our case illustrates an atypical clinical presentation of cutaneous lymphoma in a young patient. With a fatal outcome in 9 months despite 5 different lines of treatment, our case highlights the aggressive nature of Sezary syndrome as well as the difficulties involved in treating this disease. CONCLUSION: A diagnosis of Sezary syndrome must be considered in the event of atypical dermatosis in patients of all ages. The presence of lymphomatous clonal cells and Sezary cells in the blood, immunophenotyping of lymphocytes in blood and marrow, and a second reading of the cutaneous biopsy results enabled us to make a diagnosis of Sezary syndrome."

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with relapsed/refractory non-Hodgkin lymphoma received up to 6 GROC-Rev courses: rituximab (375 mg/m(2) provided intravenously) on day 1, oxaliplatin (100 mg/m(2) provided intravenously; 2 hours), gemcitabine (provided 1250 mg/m(2) intravenously; 30 minutes) on day 2, and pegfilgrastim (6 mg provided subcutaneously) on day 3. Patients switched to lenalidomide if they did not experience at least partial response (PR) after their second GROC-Rev course, or if they experienced less than a CR after 6 courses. RESULTS: In 33 patients, overall response was 61% (CR = 39%). Of 17 patients with PR who continued to 6 courses, 10 (59%) experienced CR and 7 PR as maximum response; of these 7, 1 died before receiving lenalidomide, 1 experienced CR while receiving lenalidomide (17%), and 2 experienced a further PR (33%). Of 16 with disease that failed to respond to GROC-Rev after their second course, 2 died before lenalidomide could be administered, and 2 experienced CR (14%) and 1 PR (7%) after lenalidomide. Overall survival and progression-free survival were 47% and 33% at 2 years.

This risk is estimated to be 17%. The most common secondary neoplasms were found in the Gastrointestinal and Genitourinary tracts. PATIENT CONCERNS: A 74-year-old Caucasian patient with melaena came to our observation in June 2015. The Esophago-gastro-duodenoscopy exam found a polypoid formation in the duodenal bulb. Histopathological examination showed a well-differentiated neuroendocrine neoplasm (G1). DIAGNOSIS: During the follow up for the neuroendocrine neoplasm, a CT scan was performed in August 2016 describing infiltration of the right renal sinus and the third proximal ureter segment with heterogeneous enhancement of vascular structure. An US-guided biopsy was conclusive for a Diffuse Large B Cell Lymphoma. In October 2016, a colonoscopy showed a neoplastic lesion at 20 cm from the anal orifice. The Histology exam was positive for an adenocarcinoma with a desmoplastic stroma infiltration. INTERVENTIONS: In November 2016, the patient underwent a left hemicolectomy: the pathologic staging described a G2 adenocarcinoma pT3N1b. In May 2018, the Octreotide scan was negative. In the same month, the patient started a treatment based on 6 cycles of Rituximab, Oxaliplatin, and Capecitabine due to the persistence of lymphomatous disease and hepatic metastases. In July 2018, other 3 cycles of the same treatment were scheduled. OUTCOMES: In January 2019, due to an increase in liver metastases' size, it was decided to start a new regimen for the colon cancer with FOLFIRI+Cetuximab. The patient is still in treatment with this regimen in April 2019. LESSONS: The risk of a second primary tumor is increased among patients older than 70. Therefore, it is necessary to follow them using total body CT scan and endoscopic techniques of gastrointestinal and genitourinary tracts, not only for the evaluation of the neuroendocrine tumor but also for the higher risk to develop other neoplastic diseases."

METHODS: We conducted a microcosting analysis from the health system perspective in the context of a prospective cohort study at a national teaching hospital in Lilongwe, Malawi. Clinical outcomes data were derived from previously published literature from the cohort. Cost data were collected for treatment and 2-year follow-up, reflecting costs incurred by the research institution or referral hospital for goods and services. Costs were collected in Malawian kwacha, inflated and converted to 2017 US dollars. RESULTS: On a per-patient basis, palliative care alone cost $728 per person. Total costs for first-line treatment with CHOP chemotherapy was $1,844, of which chemotherapy drugs made up 15%. Separate salvage EPIC and GEMOX cost $2,597 and $3,176, respectively. Chemotherapy drugs accounted for 30% of EPIC and 47% of GEMOX. CONCLUSION: To our knowledge, this is among the first published efforts to characterize detailed costs of cancer treatment in sub-Saharan Africa. The per-patient cost of first-line treatment of DLBCL in Malawi is low relative to high-income countries, suggesting that investments in fixed-duration, curative-intent DLBCL treatment may be attractive in sub-Saharan Africa. Salvage treatment of relapsed/refractory DLBCL costs much more than first-line therapy. Formal cost-effectiveness modeling for CHOP and salvage treatment in the Malawian and other low-resource settings is needed to inform decision makers about optimal use of resources for cancer treatment."

Epub 2019 Jan 7.,2019 Dec,10.1177/1078155218820108,25,8,2041-2044,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30616469,"INTRODUCTION: Several regimens for treating hematologic malignancies are given inpatient due to multiple factors. Many clinicians are evaluating methods to deliver traditionally inpatient regimens in the outpatient setting to increase patient satisfaction, improve access to therapy, and reduce costs. A regimen traditionally administered inpatient, dexamethasone, cytarabine, and cisplatin (DHAP) is a common and effective salvage regimen for relapsed/refractory non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. DHAX, which substitutes oxaliplatin for cisplatin, has been identified as a reasonable alternative to DHAP and offers the potential for tolerable administration in the outpatient setting as well. CASE DESCRIPTION: A 74-year-old patient with double hit relapsed/refractory diffuse large B cell lymphoma was given rituximab, dexamethasone, high-dose cytarabine, and oxaliplatin (R-DHAX) in our outpatient clinic; however, this regimen is traditionally administered in the inpatient setting. Our main obstacle being cytarabine doses traditionally given 12 h apart. The outpatient regimen given to our patient was rituximab and oxaliplatin on day 1, cytarabine dose one late afternoon on day 2, cytarabine dose two early morning on day 3, and dexamethasone on days 1-4. Doses of oxaliplatin and cytarabine were reduced due to thrombocytopenia experienced with Cycle 1. He did not experience any increased toxicities or complications associated with the regimen moving forward. DISCUSSION: This illustrates a unique administration of R-DHAX in an infusion center that operates during typical outpatient clinic hours. Both DHAP and DHAX, with or without rituximab, administered in the outpatient setting may be options to consider in relapsed/refractory non-Hodgkin's lymphoma."

We classified the patients according to the outcome into worse (died within 1 year) or better groups (survival time >/= 3, 4 or 5 years). The area under the curve (AUC) was determined to identify the optimal biomarker for differentiating the groups. The AUC was highest in patients who were plasma Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) DNA-positive post-treatment. The AUC was 0.82, 0.86 and 0.86 when the worse group was compared to the better group, respectively. Among the post-treatment EBV DNA-positive patients, as compared to EBV DNA-negative patients, pre-treatment EBV DNA-positive patients had a higher proportion of CD4 + CD25 + T cells. There was higher programmed cell death protein ligand-1(PD-L1) expression in post-treatment EBV DNA-positive patients.

We aimed to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and feasibility of the R-GemOx regimen as a first-line treatment in elderly patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. METHODS: In this single-arm, open-label, phase 2 clinical trial, we enrolled patients with previously untreated, histologically confirmed, CD20-positive diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, aged 70 years or older, or aged 60-69 years with an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status score of 2 or greater. Patients were recruited from Jiangsu Province Hospital (Jiangsu Sheng, China). The R-GemOx regimen was administered intravenously: rituximab 375 mg/m(2) on day 0; gemcitabine 1 g/m(2) on day 1; and oxaliplatin 100 mg/m(2) on day 1. The cycle was repeated every 14 days. Six cycles were planned if the patient achieved at least partial remission after the interim assessment. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients who achieved an overall response at the end of treatment (defined as complete response plus partial response). Analyses were done by intention to treat. The trial is ongoing but no longer recruiting patients. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01670370. FINDINGS: Between Aug 22, 2012, and Dec 31, 2015, 60 patients were enrolled and included in the study. The median age of the patients was 75 years (IQR 70-80) and 27 (45%) patients had a poor performance status with an ECOG score of 2 or greater. 45 (75%) patients achieved an overall response at the end of the treatment, with 28 (47%) achieving a complete response. Common grade 3-4 adverse events were haematological toxicities (thrombocytopenia in five [8%] patients, anaemia in four [7%], and neutropenia in nine [15%]) and gastrointestinal complications (nausea in five [8%] patients, vomiting in three [5%], and diarrhoea in one [2%]). No treatment-related deaths were reported. INTERPRETATIONS: The R-GemOx regimen shows high efficacy and safety as a front-line treatment in an elderly patient subpopulation and might be a therapeutic option for management of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma in elderly patients.

Although B-cell lymphoma with abundant expression of T-cell markers exist, the opposite is very rare. Therefore, little is known about this subtype of lymphoma, including its treatment and prognosis. CASE REPORT: A 65-year-old man was diagnosed with T-cell lymphoma with abundant CD20 expression. He was refractory to cyclophosphamide + epirubicin + vincristine + prednisone + etoposide (CHOPE), ifosfamide + cisplatin + etoposide + dexamethasone (DICE), and hyper-cyclophosphamide + vincristine + epirubicin + dexamethasone (CVAD) chemotherapy. The patient was also treated with prednisone + thalidomide + chidamide, which was also not effective. Upon admission to our department, he was administered a rituximab + gemcitabine + oxiplatin + L-asparaginase (R-pGEMOX) regimen and achieved partial remission. LESSONS: CD20-positive T-cell lymphoma is a very rare type of lymphoma that is refractory to CHOP-like regimens alone. Rituximab may be effective in patients showing abundant CD20 expression, and an R-pGEMOX regimen will likely be effective, even in refractory/recurrent patients."

This research aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the GELOXD or P-GEMOXD regimens in patients with ENKTCL. METHODS: Newly diagnosed ENKTCL patients treated with either the GELOXD or the P-GEMOXD regimen were identified from three cancer centers between January 2010 and December 2016. Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression analyses were used to calculate overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) and to investigate prognostic factors. RESULTS: One hundred and eighty-four cases were identified from three cancer centers. After 1-5 treatment cycles of GELOXD or P-GEMOXD chemotherapy, 155 (84%) patients showed a complete response (CR). The 3-year OS (73.0% vs 38.2%, P = .001) and PFS (72.8% vs 32.4%, P = .000) rates were significantly higher in early-stage patients compared with advanced-stage patients. A multivariate analysis revealed that patient CR status was a significant independent factor in disease prognosis. Grade 3/4 leukopenia occurred in 43 (23.4%) patients. Major non-hematological toxicities included nausea (n = 117, 63.6%) and vomiting (n = 66, 35.9%). CONCLUSIONS: The GELOXD and P-GEMOXD chemotherapy regimens are well tolerated and provide favorable survival outcomes in patients with ENKTCL."

Results: From 2008 to 2013, 1,312 patients with breast cancer who received docetaxel and cyclophosphamide (TC; n=853) or docetaxel, carboplatin, and trastuzumab (TCH; n=459); 1,321 patients with colorectal cancer who received capecitabine and oxaliplatin (XELOX; n=401) or leucovorin, 5-fluorouracil, and oxaliplatin (FOLFOX6; n=920); 307 patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma who received bendamustine with or without rituximab; and 181 patients with multiple myeloma who received lenalidomide with or without dexamethasone were included. Crude FN risk was >20% for both breast cancer regimens (TC and TCH). Crude FN risks for XELOX, FOLFOX6, bendamustine, and lenalidomide were <10%; however, when potential FN misclassification and censoring were considered, FN risks were >10%. Conclusions: Our results support published literature highlighting the real-world, ""high"" FN risk of the TC and TCH regimens for breast cancer. There is strong suggestive evidence that FN risks for XELOX, FOLFOX6, bendamustine, and lenalidomide are >10%. Calculation of chemotherapy course-level FN incidence without controlling for differential censoring for patients who discontinued regimens early, or possible FN misclassification, might have resulted in bias toward an underestimation of the true FN risk. These findings help define FN risk of the selected regimens in the real-world setting and inform prophylactic G-CSF use."

Crossover to lenalidomide was permitted for IC-treated patients with radiologically confirmed progressive disease. The primary endpoint was overall response rate (ORR). Progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival, and subtype analysis [GCB vs. activated B-cell (ABC)] using gene expression profiling (GEP) were exploratory endpoints.Results: Stage 1: 102 DLBCL patients (by IHC: non-GCB, n = 54; GCB, n = 48) received >/=1 dose of lenalidomide or IC. Hematologic treatment-emergent adverse events with lenalidomide versus IC included neutropenia (42.6%; 36.4%), anemia (33.3%; 47.3%), thrombocytopenia (24.1%; 43.6%), and leukopenia (5.6%; 12.7%), respectively.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Forty-eight patients were treated with the LOP (L-asparaginase, vincristine and dexamethasone) regimen chemotherapy (CT) and 32 patients with the CHOP (cyclophosphamide, tetrahydropyanyl adriamycin, vincristine, and prednisone) regimen. These patients then received involved-field radiotherapy (RT) with the doses of DT = 49-59 Gy. RESULTS: A significant improvement of clinical end points with the LOP regimen was noticed compared with the CHOP regimen: 33 (68.8%) versus 16 (50.0%) for complete responses; 10 (20.8%) versus 5 (15.6%) for partial responses. There were statistical differences in objective response rates (43 [89.6%] for LOP vs. 21 [65.6%] for CHOP; P = .009), 3 years of overall survival (42 [87.5%] for LOP vs. 20 [62.5%] for CHOP; P = .006) and progression-free survival (32 [79.2%] for LOP vs. 16 [50.0%] for CHOP; P = .007). CONCLUSION: The results showed that the LOP regimen is safe and much more efficient than the CHOP regimen for stage IIE ENKTL patients.

ENKTL is sensitive to radiotherapy, but the prognosis is poorer than those of other types of early stage lymphoma. To date, optimal treatment strategies for patients with early stage ENKTL have not been fully defined. METHODS: We retrospectively investigated the efficacy and safety of pegaspargase, gemcitabine, and oxaliplatin (P-GEMOX) combined with different dose radiotherapy (RT) in the treatment of 35 newly diagnosed, stage IE to IIE ENKTL patients at our institution from October 2011 to September 2015. All patients were treated with RT (<54 Gy or >/=54 Gy) after an initial two cycles of P-GEMOX, and following two consolidation cycles. The primary endpoints were objective response rate and complete remission rate (CR). The secondary endpoints were 2-year overall survival (OS), 2-year progression-free survival (PFS), and toxicity. RESULTS: Thirty-three patients completed total therapy, which resulted in 94.3% of response rate that included 28 patients (80.0%) with CR and five patients (14.3%) with partial response (PR). Two (5.7%) patients progressed during therapy and six (17.1%) progressed during follow-up. The 2-year OS was 82.9%, and the 2-year PFS was 77.1%. Patients with CR, low circulating EBV DNA load (</=6.1 x 10(7) copies/ml), low NKIPI (score 0-1), and high RT dose (>/=54 Gy) were independent predictors of better prognosis. Grade 3 toxicities were few; only four (11.4%) patients experienced grade 4 toxicities. No treatment-related deaths were observed. CONCLUSIONS: The research showed that the treatment of P-GEMOX combined with RT was a tolerable and effective treatment for localized nasal natural killer/T-cell lymphoma."

Toxicities were recorded from medical files and assessed according to the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria version 3.0. Potential risk factors of renal insufficiency were tested by univariate analyses. A total of 276 patients were treated: 168 with DHAP (60.9%), 79 with DHAOX (28.6%), and 29 with DHAC (10.5%). Rituximab was associated in 80.1% of patients (n = 221). Renal failure was reported in 97 patients, mainly with cisplatin regimen (86.6%) leading to 8.9% grade III to IV renal failure (P = .001). Renal insufficiency was reversible in most patients but remained persistent in 24, with all of them being treated with DHAP except 1. Cisplatin-based regimen (50.0% versus 12.0%, P < .05) and female (44.6% versus 29.7%, P < .05) appeared to be at higher risks of renal failure. Platinum cumulative dose is a significant risk factor of nephrotoxicity. Hematologic toxicity was more frequent with carboplatin and cisplatin with at least 1 event (all toxicity grade) respectively in 79.3% and 71.4% of patients treated (P < .005). Auditory toxicity was mainly reported with cisplatin (n = 19; 4 grade I-II and 15 grade III-IV). Oxaliplatin was implicated in 77.6% of neurotoxicity (n = 59), mainly moderate (grade I-II). In conclusion, DHAOX and DHAC regimens have more favorable toxicity profile than DHAP regimen. Their lack of renal toxicity makes them attractive regimens, which may be interesting for patients eligible for autologous stem cell transplantation. Nevertheless, these results have to be confirmed by the therapeutic efficacy of these 3 regimens."

Major changes have recently been implemented in the management of MCL, but continuous relapses still mark this disease as a challenge for clinicians. We previously reported the efficacy of GemOx-R (Gemcitabine, Oxaliplatin and Rituximab) in patients with refractory and relapsing MCL. We present results for a larger series with longer follow-up and including high-risk frontline patients, showing an overall response rate of 83%. The efficacy of each component of GemOx-R was evaluated in a panel of MCL cell lines. Also, patient-derived primary cells were used in ex vivo experiments. The results show that oxaliplatin has a profound effect on cellular viability and is the most effective drug within this regimen. We further present synergistic efficacy of oxaliplatin combined with cytarabine in MCL cells. Interestingly, this synergistic effect was not seen when cisplatin and cytarabine were combined, indicating that among the platinum-derived agents oxaliplatin may be the preferred approach. Taken together our findings suggest that oxaliplatin alone or combined with cytarabine could constitute an alternative backbone for MCL regimens."

Its characteristics have never been systematically illustrated. We report 2 new cases of laryngeal NK/T-cell lymphoma, and we discuss the process of the diagnosis of this disease, the choice of treatment, and treatment outcomes. We also summarize all 31 cases reported thus far. Symptoms of laryngeal NK/T-cell lymphoma are difficult to differentiate from those of other laryngeal diseases. The most common laryngeal subsite in the reported cases was the supraglottis, and roughly one-third of these cases involved the cervical lymph nodes. Because of our limited experience with this disease and the difficulties encountered in interpreting the pathologic findings, most patients required multiple biopsies over a few months before their diagnosis was confirmed. The outcome of treatment was generally poor. Radiotherapy, alone or combined with chemotherapy, was superior to chemotherapy alone in treating this disease in its early stages. In view of the frequency of local lymph node metastasis, irradiation fields should cover the entire cervical area. We believe that prompt diagnosis and treatment with radiotherapy are both critical to improving survival for patients with laryngeal NK/T-cell lymphoma."
