40494466,Gelatin-dopamine-based dual-responsive nanogels for tumor-targeted bortezomib delivery: Minimizing systemic toxicity and enhancing breast cancer therapy.,"Zheng Z, Sun L, Li Y, Wang S, Wang P, Qiu S, Tian Y, Chen H",Int J Biol Macromol. 2025 Jun 8;318(Pt 4):145084. doi: 10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2025.145084.,2025 Jun 8,S0141-8130(25)05637-5 [pii] 10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2025.145084,318,Pt 4,145084,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40494466,"Breast cancer, responsible for 15 % of global cancer deaths, demands therapies that balance efficacy and safety. Bortezomib (BTZ), a proteasome inhibitor, which is typically used in cancer treatment, while limited by rapid hydrolysis (<1 h half-life), neurotoxicity, and poor tumor targeting (<5 % accumulation), requires advanced delivery strategies. We address this by engineering gelatin-dopamine (Gel-Dopa) nanogels-a biocompatible platform combining gelatin's MMP-2 responsiveness and dopamine's pH-sensitive boronate bonds for tumor-targeted BTZ release. Co-assembly with hyaluronic acid enables CD44-mediated tumor targeting, synergizing with sub-300 nm size (254 nm) for enhanced accumulation. The nanogels exhibit pH/enzyme dual-responsive release: 74.8 % cumulative BTZ release at tumor acidity (pH 5.0) vs. 32.1 % at physiological pH, with MMP-2 accelerating gelatin degradation. In vitro studies show 2.1x higher uptake in MDA-MB-231 cells than free BTZ, potent cytotoxicity (IC50 1.45 muM vs. 3.82 muM), and > 90 % normal cell viability. This dual-targeting system improves BTZ's therapeutic index by 2.6-fold. This work bridges biocompatible materials and clinical oncology by utilizing FDA-approved biopolymers (gelatin, hyaluronic acid). The design is adaptable to other protease-sensitive drugs, offering a translatable strategy to transform toxic chemotherapeutics into tumor-activated precision therapies."

Due to the absence of specific clinical symptoms, its diagnosis is often challenging. Here, we present a case of cardiac amyloidosis secondary to multiple myeloma, incidentally complicated by ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS). Although the breast cancer was diagnosed as stage 0 (DCIS), the patient's heart failure symptoms worsened following surgical resection. As a result, further evaluation by the cardiology department was performed, leading to a diagnosis of cardiac amyloidosis. Subsequently, a hematology consultation was obtained, and bone marrow biopsy revealed that clonal plasma cells accounted for more than 60% of bone marrow cellularity, confirming a diagnosis of multiple myeloma. The patient received daratumumab + bortezomib + cyclophosphamide + dexamethasone therapy, achieved a partial response, and has been alive for >2 years. This case is a valuable example of a patient who experienced a gradual onset of the symptoms of amyloidosis, including palpitations, pleural effusion, right and left heart failure, before a diagnosis could be made. It took a total of eight departments to make a diagnosis, as it was challenging. Even if no abnormalities are observed in a single examination, it is important to listen carefully to patient complaints, repeat the examination if necessary, and work with multiple departments to provide treatment."

Epub 2025 Apr 14.,2025 May 5,10.1021/acs.molpharmaceut.4c01283,22,5,2482-2493,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40223780,"Nanoparticle albumin-bound (NAB) formulations are emerging as a viable strategy for the intravenous delivery of poorly water-soluble drugs. This study aims to improve the therapeutic profile of Bortezomib (BTZ), addressing its low solubility and significant systemic toxicity through the development of NAB-BTZ nanoparticles. The synthesized nanoparticles exhibited an average size of 296.47 +/- 10 nm and a high drug encapsulation efficiency of 75%, and a drug loading of 10%. NAB-BTZ displayed a controlled, pH-sensitive release profile, with 59% release at pH 5.4 (mimicking tumor environments) and 46% at pH 7.4 after 12 h. In vitro assays demonstrated that NAB-BTZ significantly reduced the viability of 4T1 mammary carcinoma cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner, increasing late apoptosis from 6% to 54% after 48 h, compared to 24% for free BTZ. At molecular level, NAB-BTZ induced apoptosis by upregulating p53 and Bax, downregulating Bcl-2, and activating caspases 3 and 7. In vivo tests in a murine 4T1 breast cancer model showed that NAB-BTZ substantially inhibited tumor growth, achieving an average tumor volume of 916 mm(3) by day 31 versus 1400 mm(3) for free BTZ, leading to an improved survival rate of 100% compared to 83% in the BTZ group. Technetium-99m ((99m)Tc) labeling and SPECT imaging confirmed enhanced targeting capability, showing preferential accumulation of NAB-BTZ in tumor sites compared to free BTZ. These findings suggest that NAB-BTZ not only improves antitumor efficacy but also enhances its safety profile, underscoring its clinical potential in breast cancer therapy."
40205824,A Journey Around Boronic Acids: Sulfonyl Hydrazone-Containing Derivatives as Carbonic Anhydrase Inhibitors.,"Anakok DA, Angeli A, D'Agostino I, Renzi G, Massardi ML, Tavani C, Cete S, Carradori S, Ronca R, Capasso C, Carta F, Supuran CT",Chem Biol Drug Des. 2025 Apr;105(4):e70108. doi: 10.1111/cbdd.70108.,2025 Apr,10.1111/cbdd.70108,105,4,e70108,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40205824,"Recently, a rising interest in boronic acids and their derivatives was recorded in the Medicinal Chemistry field due to their high versatility and broad applicability as bioactive compounds in several diseases, including cancer and microbial infections. The ability of boronic acid moieties to bind zinc ions was first hypothesized by the inhibitory activity of bortezomib, a boron-containing protease inhibitor, on different isoforms of the Carbonic Anhydrase (CA, EC: 4.2.1.1) enzyme family and then assessed through X-ray crystallographic studies on benzoxaboroles in complex with hCA II. These findings, along with the overexpression of isoforms IX and XII in hypoxic cancer and, in particular, breast cancer, drove us to explore the chemical space around the phenylboronic acids by generating a focused library of 16 derivatives (1-4a-d) decorated with alkyl sulfonyl hydrazones. The compounds were then subjected to stopped flow-based inhibition assays on a panel of hCAs, including the tumor-associated isoforms, revealing low micromolar inhibition constants (K(I)s) in some cases. However, antiproliferative assays conducted on a human triple-negative breast cancer cell line showed a lack of activity at the tested concentrations."

The aim of this study was to identify the molecular characteristics associated with glioma prognosis and explore its potential function. We analyzed RNA-seq data from The Cancer Genome Atlas and identified differentially expressed mitochondrial long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) using R's 'limma' package. A prognostic model was developed using 10 selected lncRNAs and validated with Cox regression and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator algorithm. The model's efficacy was assessed using Kaplan-Meier and receiver operating characteristic curve analyses, and its correlation with immune cell profiles and drug sensitivity was explored. A 10-mitochondria-related LncRNA signature was generated. The median risk score values are used to classify glioma samples into low-risk and high-risk groups. In breast patients, the signature-based risk score demonstrated a more potent ability to predict survival than conventional clinicopathological features. Furthermore, we noted a substantial disparity in the number of immune cells, including B cells, CD8 + T cells, and macrophages, between the two groups. In addition, the high-risk group exhibited lower half-maximal inhibitory concentration values for specific chemotherapy medications, including bortezomib, luminespib, rapamycin, and 5-fluorouracil. Our study elucidates the diagnostic and prognostic value of mitochondria-related-lncRNAs in the promotion, suppression, and treatment of glioma."

Epub 2025 Feb 17.,2025 May,10.1002/smtd.202400991,9,5,e2400991,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39962810,"Accurate prediction of cancer drug responses is crucial for personalized therapy. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) captures cellular heterogeneity and rare resistant populations, offering valuable insights into treatment responses. However, the distinct distributions of bulk RNA-seq and scRNA-seq data hinder the transfer of drug response knowledge from large-scale cell line datasets. To address this, single-cell Pathway Drug Sensitivity (scPDS) model is developed, a Transformer-based deep learning method that predicts drug sensitivities from scRNA-seq data through pathway activation transformation. By integrating bulk RNA-seq data from extensive cell line datasets, scPDS improves accuracy and computational efficiency in scRNA-seq analysis. It is demonstrated that scPDS outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both time and memory consumption. When applied to breast cancer cells treated with bortezomib, scPDS showed that resistance increases initially but diminishes with prolonged exposure. The method also identifies drug-sensitive populations in bortezomib-resistant cells and predicts the efficacy of combination therapies, including docetaxel, gemcitabine, and irinotecan. Furthermore, scPDS successfully distinguishes between sensitive and resistant patients, predicting significantly different survival outcomes. In summary, scPDS offers a robust tool for predicting cellular responses, providing insights to optimize cancer treatment strategies."
39862152,Bortezomib suppresses TGF-beta1-mediated LOXL4 reduction through the inhibition of MEK/ERK pathways in MDA-MB-231 cells.,"Kamiya T, Ishii K, Ozawa K, Hara H",J Recept Signal Transduct Res. 2025 Feb;45(1):73-82. doi: 10.1080/10799893.2025.2455594.

Among the LOX family of enzymes, LOX-like 4 (LOXL4) exhibits pro-tumor and anti-tumor properties; therefore, the functional role of LOXL4 in tumor progression is still under investigation. Here, we first determined that transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1) significantly decreased LOXL4 expression in human breast cancer MDA-MB-231 cells, which suggested that decreased LOXL4 may participate in tumor progression. In this study, we also investigated how TGF-beta1 decreases LOXL4 expression. TGF-beta1-induced intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) played a role in LOXL4 protein expression but had no effect on LOXL4 mRNA levels. The proteasomal inhibitor, bortezomib, significantly suppressed TGF-beta1-mediated LOXL4 reduction, which indicated that TGF-beta1 facilitates LOXL4 proteasomal degradation. Furthermore, bortezomib inhibited TGF-beta1-induced MEK/ERK pathways which are involved in LOXL4 reduction and TGF-beta1-mediated cell migration. Finally, we also determined the potential role of N-glycosylation in LOXL4 secretion. We found that the dysregulation of N-glycosylation may be involved in the reduction in LOXL4 secretion. Overall, bortezomib is expected to inhibit TNBC progression by inhibiting both the MEK/ERK and proteasomal degradation pathways, which regulate LOXL4 expression."

There is a lack of comprehensive studies evaluating the effects of various Centaurea spp. plant extracts on chemotherapy outcomes, highlighting the need for caution and medical supervision. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of five Centaurea spp. extracts in concentrations of 125 mug/ml and 250 mug/ml on the cytotoxicity induced by doxorubicin (DOX, 1 muM) in MCF-7 breast cancer cells and by bortezomib (BOR, 7 nM) in PC-3 prostate cancer cells. Selected cell lines were treated with drugs and extracts or combined for 48 h. Biological assays revealed that four out of five tested extracts abolished the cytotoxic effects of DOX and BOR. The extracts showed low antioxidant activity compared to Trolox, with no correlation to total compound content, indicating the abolition of the cytotoxic effect was not due to antioxidant activity. However, genotoxicity and DNA damage response studies showed a protective effect of the extract on the DNA of cancer cells and upregulation of DNA repair, which may underlie the reversal of the chemotherapy effect."

Herein, based on computer-aided strategies, important physicochemical properties are identified to guide the rational design of self-assembled compounds. Then, the pharmacophore hybridization strategy is used to design self-assemble nanoparticles by preparing new chemical structures by combining pharmacophore groups of different bioactive compounds. Hydroxychloroquine is grafted with the lipophilic vitamin E succinate and then co-assembled with bortezomib to fabricate the nanoparticle. The nanoparticle can reduce M2-type tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) through lysosomal alkalization and induce immunogenic cell death (ICD) and nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) inhibition in tumor cells. In mouse models, the nanoparticles induce decreased levels of M2-type TAMs, regulatory T cells, and transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta), and increase the proportion of cytotoxicity T lymphocytes. Additionally, the nanoparticles reduce the secretion of Interleukin-6 (IL-6) by inhibiting NF-kappaB and enhance the programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1) checkpoint blockade therapy. The pharmacophore hybridization-derived nanoparticle provides a dual-modulation strategy to reprogram the tumor microenvironment, which will efficiently enhance the chemoimmunotherapy against triple-negative breast cancer."

Here, we aimed to explore combination of proteasome inhibitor; bortezomib (BTZ) with natural antioxidants (AOs); polyphenols like caffeic acid (CFA), resveratrol (RES), fucoidan (FD), and synthetic AO; sodium selenite (Na(2)SeO(3)) for cellular cytotoxicity in breast cancer cell lines; MCF-7 and MDA MB-231. The combination of RES + BTZ, FD + BTZ, and Na(2)SeO(3) + BTZ showed synergism while CFA showed antagonism with BTZ. The EC(50) values of different combinations were found to be significantly less than the individual AOs in ABTS and DPPH assay. Furthermore, the effect of combination of drugs on migratory properties of MCF-7 cells were evaluated by in-vitro wound healing assay, resulting in the reduction of such behavior. In support of this, RT-qPCR was performed to analyze differential gene expressions of apoptotic and Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition (EMT) markers with and without treatment. In results, the combination of Na(2)SeO(3) + BTZ reduced the expression of Bcl-XL and N-Cad causing cytotoxicity and suggested that the combination of Na(2)SeO(3) + BTZ (IC(50) = 1.40 +/- 0.45 muM) could be a better option among other combinations for breast cancer therapy. Overall, the outcome indicates that the combination of BTZ with AOs may yield potential therapeutic benefit."

PATIENTS AND METHODS: We evaluated the development of post-infection immunity in five patients with malignancies who received mAB therapy targeting spike protein for their PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection in 2021, compared with non-mAB controls. Patients were identified from a larger study on oncology with a history or documented current infection with SARS-CoV-2. Subjects include two patients with lymphoma and CD20-depletion therapy, one with myeloma and two with solid tumor (stage IIA rectal adenocarcinoma and metastatic breast cancer). Cancer therapies and COVID vaccination history varied by patient. Blood samples (1-4 per patient) were collected 71-635 days post-mAB therapy. We employed clinical histories with comprehensive immunoprofiling analysis, including systems serology antibody isotyping and effector function, T-cell immunophenotyping for subset and memory cells, and sensitive blood viral RNA detection up to 2 years post-mAB therapy. RESULTS: B-cell deficiency was confirmed in 3/5 patients. All patients had detectable anti-spike and nucleoprotein antibody isotypes, effector functions, and neutralizing antibodies (which increased over time by subject) at similar levels to the control group. Virus-specific T-cell activation and phenotypes varied by time and patient. Spike-specific effector and memory CD8 + T-cells were significantly elevated in mAB subjects compared to the control group. SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA detection was also higher in mAB-treated patients. One patient on bortezomib therapy had unique alterations in these populations. CONCLUSION: All mAB-treated patients with malignancies developed polyfunctional immunity humoral and T-cell immunity to SARS-CoV-2 even in the setting of B-cell deficiency. The evolution of this immunity, including new variant-specific antibodies, without secondary illnesses suggests that patients were protected from symptomatic re-infection, and mAB therapy did not blunt the development of host immunity. Future studies are warranted to better characterize immunologic memory over time with exposures to new viral variants, evaluate prolonged viral shedding and the continued use of appropriate mAB for infection in high-risk patients."

It has a complex role in cancer biology, influencing both the progression and suppression of tumors by modulating malignant properties of tumor cells and anti-tumor immunity, depending on the specific tumor type and developmental stage. This has led to the discovery and development of selective AhR modulators, including BAY 2416964 which is currently in clinical trials. To identify small molecule anticancer agents that might be combined with AhR antagonists for cancer therapy, a high-throughput combination screen was performed using multi-cell type tumor spheroids grown from malignant cells, endothelial cells, and mesenchymal stem cells. The AhR selective antagonists BAY 2416964, GNF351, and CH-223191 were tested individually and in combination with twenty-five small molecule anticancer agents. As single agents, BAY 2416964 and CH-223191 showed minimal activity, whereas GNF351 reduced the viability of some spheroid models at concentrations greater than 1 microM. The activity of most combinations aligned well with the single agent activity of the combined agent, without apparent contributions from the AhR antagonist. All three AhR antagonists sensitized tumor spheroids to TAK-243, an E1 ubiquitin-activating enzyme inhibitor. These combinations were active in spheroids containing bladder, breast, ovary, kidney, pancreas, colon, and lung tumor cell lines. The AhR antagonists also potentiated pevonedistat, a selective inhibitor of the NEDD8-activating enzyme E1 regulatory subunit, in several tumor spheroid models. In contrast, the AhR antagonists did not enhance the cytotoxicity of the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib."

In vitro validation of candidate compounds was then performed to assess proteasomal proteolytic activity, accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins, cell viability, and drug-induced expression in A375 melanoma and MCF7 breast cancer cells. Using this approach, we identified six compounds with PI properties ((-)-kinetin-riboside, manumycin-A, puromycin dihydrochloride, resistomycin, tegaserod maleate, and thapsigargin). Although the docking scores pinpointed their ability to bind to the beta5 subunit, our in vitro study revealed that these compounds inhibited the beta1, beta2, and beta5 catalytic sites to some extent. As shown with bortezomib, only manumycin-A, puromycin dihydrochloride, and tegaserod maleate resulted in excessive accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins and elevated HMOX1 expression. Taken together, our integrated drug repositioning approach and subsequent in vitro validation studies identified six compounds demonstrating properties similar to proteasome inhibitors."

Cancer cell lines derived from cancers of the blood, kidney, nervous system, and skin were found to be significantly more sensitive to bortezomib than other organ systems. The in vitro studies confirmed that although bortezomib effectively inhibited the beta5 catalytic site in all four cell lines, cell cycle arrest was only induced in G2/M phase and apoptosis in A-375 and A-172 after 24h. The genomic and transcriptomic analyses identified 33 genes (e.g. ALDH18A1, ATAD2) associated with bortezomib resistance.

Epub 2024 Jul 5.,2024 Sep,10.1038/s41416-024-02774-9,131,5,918-930,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38969867,"BACKGROUND: Resistance to chemotherapy is a major problem in the treatment of patients with triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). Preclinical data suggest that TNBC is dependent on proteasomes; however, clinical observations indicate that the efficacy of proteasome inhibitors in TNBC may be limited, suggesting the need for combination therapies. METHODS: We compared bortezomib and carfilzomib and their combinations with nelfinavir and lopinavir in TNBC cell lines and primary cells with regard to their cytotoxic activity, functional proteasome inhibition, and induction of the unfolded protein response (UPR). Furthermore, we evaluated the involvement of sXBP1, ABCB1, and ABCG2 in the cytotoxic activity of drug combinations. RESULTS: Carfilzomib, via proteasome beta5 + beta2 inhibition, is more cytotoxic in TNBC than bortezomib, which inhibits beta5 + beta1 proteasome subunits. The cytotoxicity of carfilzomib was significantly potentiated by nelfinavir or lopinavir. Carfilzomib with lopinavir induced endoplasmic reticulum stress and pro-apoptotic UPR through the accumulation of excess proteasomal substrate protein in TNBC in vitro. Moreover, lopinavir increased the intracellular availability of carfilzomib by inhibiting carfilzomib export from cells that express high levels and activity of ABCB1, but not ABCG2. CONCLUSION: Proteasome inhibition by carfilzomib combined with nelfinavir/lopinavir represents a potential treatment option for TNBC, warranting further investigation."

Unfortunately, its use can contribute to several side effects, including gynotoxic effects in women. Ovarian reserve suppression and estrogen deficiency result in reduced quality of life for cancer patients and are frequently the cause of infertility and early menopause. Classic alkylating cytostatics are among the most toxic chemotherapeutics in this regard. They cause DNA damage in ovarian follicles and the cells they contain, and they can also induce oxidative stress or affect numerous signaling pathways. In vitro tests, animal models, and a few studies among women have investigated the effects of various agents on the protection of the ovarian reserve during classic chemotherapy. In this review article, we focused on the possible beneficial effects of selected hormones (anti-Mullerian hormone, ghrelin, luteinizing hormone, melatonin), agents affecting the activity of apoptotic pathways and modulating gene expression (C1P, S1P, microRNA), and several natural (quercetin, rapamycin, resveratrol) and synthetic compounds (bortezomib, dexrazoxane, goserelin, gonadoliberin analogs, imatinib, metformin, tamoxifen) in preventing gynotoxic effects induced by commonly used cytostatics. The presented line of research appears to provide a promising strategy for protecting and/or improving the ovarian reserve in the studied group of cancer patients. However, well-designed clinical trials are needed to unequivocally assess the effects of these agents on improving hormonal function and fertility in women treated with ovotoxic anticancer drugs."

This research constructed a prognostic signature related to ubiquitination and investigated its correlation with the response to immunotherapy in HCC. The Molecular Signatures Database provided a compilation of genes associated with ubiquitination. A gene signature related to ubiquitination was obtained through Cox regression using the Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator method. The genetic factors CPY26B1, MCM10, SPINK4, and TRIM54 notably impacted the outcomes of HCC. The patients were divided into two groups: one group had a high risk of poor survival while the other had a low risk but a greater chance of controlling HCC progression. Both univariate and multivariate analyses using Cox regression found the risk score to be an independent predictor of HCC prognosis. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) indicated enrichment in cell cycle and cancer-related microRNAs in high-risk groups. The tumor microenvironment (TME), response to immunotherapy, and effectiveness of chemotherapy medications positively correlated with the risk score. In the high-risk group, erlotinib showed higher IC50 values compared to the low-risk group which exhibited higher IC50 values for VX-11e, AKT inhibitor VIII, AT-7519, BMS345541, Bortezomib, CP466722, FMK, and JNK-9L. The results of RT-qPCR revealed that the expression of four UEGs was higher in tumor tissue as compared to normal tissue. Based on the genes that were expressed differently and associated with ubiquitination-related tumor categorization, we have developed a pattern of four genes and a strong nomogram that can predict the prognosis of HCC, which could be useful in identifying and managing HCC."

However, high-throughput in vitro drug screening of cell lines is a powerful tool for identifying effective drugs for a disease. Here, we determine the intrinsic chemosensitivity of TNBC cell lines to proteasome inhibitors (PIs), thereby identifying potentially potent 2-drug combinations for TNBC. Eight TNBC cell lines (BT-549, CAL-148, HCC1806, HCC38, HCC70, MDA-MB-436, MDA-MB-453, and MDA-MB-468) and two controls (MCF-10A and MCF-7) were first exposed to 18 drugs (11 PIs and 7 clinically relevant chemotherapeutic agents) as monotherapy, followed by prediction of potent 2-drug combinations using the IDACombo pipeline. The synergistic effects of the 2-drug combinations were evaluated with SynergyFinder in four TNBC cell lines (CAL-148, HCC1806, HCC38, and MDA-MB-468) and three controls (BT-474, MCF-7, and T47D) in vitro, followed by further evaluation of tumor regression in zebrafish tumor models established using HCC1806 and MCF-7 cells. Monotherapy identified nine effective drugs (bortezomib, carfilzomib, cisplatin, delanzomib, docetaxel, epoxomicin, MLN-2238, MLN-9708, and nedaplatin) across all cell lines. PIs (e.g., bortezomib, delanzomib, and epoxomicin) were highly potent drugs in TNBC cells, of which bortezomib and delanzomib inhibited the chymotrypsin-like activity of the 20 S proteasome by 100% at 10 microM. Moreover, several potent 2-drug combinations (e.g., bortezomib+nedaplatin and epoxomicin+epirubicin) that killed virtually 100% of cells were also identified. Although HCC1806- and MCF-7-derived xenografts treated with bortezomib+nedaplatin and carboplatin+paclitaxel were smaller, HCC1806 cells frequently metastasized to the trunk region. Taken together, we show that PIs used in combination with platinum agents or topoisomerase inhibitors exhibit increased efficiency with almost 100% inhibition in TNBC cell lines, indicating that PIs are therefore promising compounds to use as combination therapy for TNBC."

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have emerged as promising key players in the regulation of pathological processes in BrCa. Proteasome inhibitors (PIs) emerged as promising anticancer agents for several human malignancies, including BrCa, inhibiting the function of the proteasome. Aiming to shed light on the miRNA regulatory effect in BrCa after treatment with PIs, we used two PIs, namely bortezomib and carfilzomib. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Four BrCa cell lines of distinct molecular subtypes were treated with these PIs. Cell viability and IC(50) concentrations were determined. Total RNA was extracted, polyadenylated, and reversely transcribed. Next, the levels of specific miRNAs with a significant role in BrCa were determined using relative quantification, and their regulatory effect was assessed. RESULTS: High heterogeneity was discovered in the levels of miRNAs in the four cell lines, after treatment. The miRNA levels fluctuate with distinct patterns, in 24, 48, or 72 hours. Interestingly, miR-1-3p, miR-421-3p, and miR-765-3p appear as key molecules, as they were found deregulated, in almost all combinations of cell lines and PIs. In the SK-BR-3 cell line, the majority of the miRNAs were significantly downregulated in treated compared to untreated cells, with miR-21-5p being the only one upregulated. Finally, various significant biological processes, molecular functions, and pathways were predicted to be affected. CONCLUSIONS: The diversity of pathways predicted to be affected by the diversity in miRNA expression after treatment with PIs paves the way for the recognition of new regulatory axes in BrCa."

The activity of compounds has been found to increase with the addition of boron atoms to the structure. In addition to these compounds, studies have found that fingolimod (FTY720) is more effective against breast cancer than cisplatin. Therefore, in this study, the first examples of boron-containing derivatives of fingolimod were designed and synthesized; in addition, their structures were confirmed by spectroscopic techniques. The synthesized boron-containing drug candidates were found to significantly inhibit cell proliferation and induce apoptosis-mediated cell death in HT-29 (colorectal cells), SaOs-2 (osteosarcoma cells), and U87-MG (glioblastoma cells). Moreover, we revealed that the anticancer effects of boron-containing fingolimod compounds were found to be significantly enhanced over boron-free control groups and, strikingly, over the widely used anticancer drug 5-fluorouracil. The metabolomic analysis confirmed that administration of the boron-containing drug candidates induces significant changes in the metabolite profiles in HT-29, SaOs-2, and U87-MG cells. Altogether, our results showed that boron-containing fingolimod compounds can be further examined to reveal their potential as anticancer drug candidates."

One of the main reasons for this failure is insufficient accumulation of the optimal dose at the tumorous site. Our investigation implies a promising strategy to engineer prodrug nanoparticles (NPs) of bortezomib (BTZ) and selenium (Se) using sialic acid (SAL) as a ligand to improve breast cancer therapy. BTZ was conjugated with SAL and HPMA (N-2-hydroxypropyl methacrylamide) to prepare a prodrug conjugate; BTZ-SAL-HPMA (BSAL-HP) and then fabricated into prodrug NPs with Se (Se_BSAL-HP prodrug NPs). The self-assembly of prodrug NPs functionalized with Se showed size (204.13 +/- 0.02 nm) and zeta potential (-31.0 +/- 0.11 mV) in dynamic light scattering (DLS) experiments and spherical shape in TEM and SEM analysis. Good stability and low pH drug release profile were characterized by Se_BSAL-HP prodrug NPs. The tumor-selective boronate-ester-based prodrug NPs of BTZ in combination with Se endowed a synergistic effect against cancer cells. Compared to prodrug conjugate, Se_BSAL-HP prodrug NPs exhibited higher cell cytotoxicity and enhanced cellular internalization with significant changes in mitochondria membrane potential (MMP). Elevated apoptosis was observed in the (G2/M) phase of the cell cycle for Se_BSAL-HP prodrug NPs (2.7-fold) higher than BTZ. In vivo studies were performed on Sprague-Dawley rats and resulted in positive trends. The increased therapeutic activity of Se_BSAL-HP prodrug NPs inhibited primary tumor growth and showed 43.05 fold decrease in tumor volume than the control in 4T1 tumor bearing mice. The surprising and remarkable outcomes for Se_BSAL-HP prodrug NPs were probably due to the ROS triggering effect of boronate ester and selenium given together."

Currently, a mounting body of evidences support the clinical strategies for extending the benefit of PARP inhibitors beyond BRCA-mutant cancers. However, the functions and molecular mechanisms of PARP inhibitors in thyroid cancers (TCs) are not fully understood. Here, on the one hand, we revealed that niraparib promotes the accumulation of DNA damage in TCs. On the other hand, we indicated that niraparib inhibits the transcription of DIMT1 through promoting Pol II pausing in a PAR-dependent manner, subsequently leading to a global translation inhibition in TCs. Meanwhile, we found that niraparib activates the NF-kappaB signaling pathway by inhibiting the PARylation of p65, which decreases its ubiquitination and degradation level through E3 ubiquitin ligase RNF146. Moreover, bortezomib (a small molecule inhibitor of the NF-kappaB signaling pathway) could significantly enhance the anti-tumor effect of niraparib on TCs in vitro and in vivo. Our findings provide mechanistic supports for the efficacy of PARP inhibitors in cancer cells lacking BRCA-mutant."

Identifying new biomarkers is thus of great significance for the diagnosis and prognosis of BC. METHODS: In this study, 1,030 BC cases from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) were obtained for differential expression analysis and Short Time-series Expression Miner (STEM) analysis to identify characteristic BC development genes, which were further divided into upregulated and downregulated genes. Two predictive prognosis models were both defined by Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO). Survival analysis and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis were used to determine the diagnostic and prognostic capabilities of the two gene set model scores, respectively. RESULTS: Our findings from this study suggested that both the unfavorable (BC1) and favorable (BC2) gene sets are reliable biomarkers for the diagnosis and prognosis of BC, although the BC1 model presents better diagnostic and prognostic value. Associations between the models and M2 macrophages and sensitivity to Bortezomib were also found, indicating that unfavorable BC genes are significantly involved in the tumor immune microenvironment. CONCLUSIONS: We successfully established one predictive prognosis model (BC1) based on characteristic gene sets of BC to diagnose and predict the survival time of BC patients using a cluster of 12 differentially expressed genes (DEGs)."

To address this challenge, we systematically analyzed drug combination datasets curated from multiple databases to identify drug pairs more likely to show synergy. We classified drug pairs based on their MoA and discovered that 110 MoA pairs were significantly enriched in synergy in at least one type of cancer. To improve the accuracy of predicting synergistic effects of drug pairs, we developed a suite of machine learning models that achieve better predictive performance. Unlike most previous methods that were rarely validated by wet-lab experiments, our models were validated using two-dimensional cell lines and three-dimensional tumor slice culture (3D-TSC) models, implying their practical utility. Our prediction and validation results indicated that the combination of the RTK inhibitors Lapatinib and Pazopanib exhibited a strong therapeutic effect in breast cancer by blocking the downstream PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway. Furthermore, we incorporated molecular features to identify potential biomarkers for synergistic drug pairs, and almost all potential biomarkers found connections between drug targets and corresponding molecular features using protein-protein interaction network. Overall, this study provides valuable insights to complement and guide rational efforts to develop drug combination treatments."

Cell lines derived from diverse cancer types (ovarian, triple negative breast, colon, cervical and prostate cancers, multiple myeloma and glioblastoma) were sensitive to Up284, including several lines resistant to bortezomib or cisplatin. Up284 and cisplatin showed synergistic cytotoxicity in vitro. Up284-induced cytotoxicity was associated with mitochondrial dysfunction, elevated levels of reactive oxygen species, accumulation of very high molecular weight polyubiquitinated protein aggregates, an unfolded protein response and the early onset of apoptosis. Up284 and RA190, but not bortezomib, enhanced antigen presentation in vitro. Up284 cleared from plasma in a few hours and accumulated in major organs by 24 h. A single dose of Up284, when administered to mice intra peritoneally or orally, inhibited proteasome function in both muscle and tumor for >48 h.

In this study, bortezomib (BTZ) is selected for the treatment of breast cancer; it has multiple pharmacological mechanisms for killing tumor cells through the NF-kappaB signaling pathway, inhibiting the activity of CAFs by activating caspase-3, and enhancing the function of CD8+ T cells by regulating the expression of immune-stimulating factors. To improve the druggability of BTZ in solid tumors, BTZ-loaded lipid/glycocholic acid mixed micelles (BTZ-LGs) were prepared to verify the ""three-in-one"" effect in killing tumor cells, inhibiting CAFs, and improving immune responses. In the present work, BTZ-LGs were verified to show enhanced in vitro cytotoxicity in both 4T1 cells and 4T1/NIH3T3 co-cultured cells, as well as a superior in vivo treatment effect in different tumor-bearing mouse models. Additionally, BTZ-LGs could regulate the expression of alpha-SMA, caspase-3, E-cadherin, and N-cadherin, indicating their good inhibiting ability on both tumor cells and CAFs. More importantly, immunological analysis revealed that BTZ-LGs promoted the expression of the immunostimulatory factor IL-2 in tumor tissues, activated anti-tumor T cells, and overcame tumor-induced CD8+ T cell dysfunction. All these findings suggest that BTZ-LGs can achieve a ""three-in-one"" effect in terms of killing tumor cells, suppressing CAFs, and improving immune responses.

The residual tumor cells after surgical resections and an acidic tumor microenvironment are unfavorable for osteogenic induction. Bortezomib (BTZ), a proteasome inhibitor used in chemotherapy, also has an osteogenic potential in concentration- and Ca(2+)-dependent manners. In this study, controlled delivery of BTZ in a novel bifunctional scaffold based on nano-hydroxyapatite (nHA) and sodium alginate (SA) nanocomposite, namely BTZ/nHA@SA, has been explored. By smartly adjusting microenvironments, a sustainable release of Ca(2+) from nHA could be achieved, which was not only able to cross-link SA but also to regulate the switch between the dual functions of tumor inhibition and bone regeneration of BTZ to promote the osteogenic pathway. The freeze-dried BTZ/nHA@SA scaffold has excellent interconnectivity, is capable to promote the attachment and proliferation of mouse embryonic osteoblast precursor cells, as well as effectively induces breast cancer cell death in vitro. Furthermore, in vivo, studies using a mouse tumor model and a rabbit femoral defect model showed that the BTZ/nHA@SA scaffold could promote tumor ablation, and also enhance bone repair. Therefore, the BTZ/nHA@SA scaffold has unique dual functions of inhibiting tumor recurrence and promoting bone tissue regeneration simultaneously. This smart bi-functional scaffold offers a promising novel approach for oncological treatments by synchronously orchestrating tumor inhibition and tissue regeneration for the repair of neoplastic bone defects."

Targeted alpha-emitting radiopharmaceuticals that are highly cytotoxic may fulfill this critical need. The focus of this paper is to describe and explore a novel technology that may improve the therapeutic effect of targeted alpha therapy by combining two radionuclides from the same decay chain in the same solution. We hypothesize that the dual targeting solution containing bone-seeking (224)Ra and cell-directed complexes of progeny (212)Pb is a promising approach to treat metastatic cancers with bone and soft tissue lesions as well as skeletal metastases of mixed lytic/osteoblastic nature. A novel liquid (224)Ra/(212)Pb-generator for rapid preparation of a dual targeting solution is described. Cancer cell targeting monoclonal antibodies, their fragments, synthetic proteins or peptides can all be radiolabeled with (212)Pb in the (224)Ra-solution in transient equilibrium with daughter nuclides. Thus, (224)Ra targets stromal elements in sclerotic bone metastases and (212)Pb-chelated-conjugate targets tumor cells of metastatic prostate cancer or osteosarcoma. The dual targeting solution may also be explored to treat metastatic breast cancer or multiple myeloma after manipulation of bone metastases to a more osteoblastic phenotype by the use of bisphosphonates, denosumab, bortezomib or hormone therapy prior to treatment. This may improve targeting of bone-seeking (224)Ra and render an augmented radiation dose deposited within metastases. Our preliminary preclinical studies provide conceptual evidence that the dual (224)Ra-solution with bone or tumor-targeted delivery of (212)Pb has potential to inhibit cancer metastases without significant toxicity. In some settings, the use of a booster dose of purified (212)Pb-conjugate alone could be required to elevate the effect of this tumor cell directed component, if needed, e.g., in a fractionated treatment regimen, where the dual targeting solution will act as maintenance treatment."

We show here that 4~5 microM AF induces paraptosis, a non-apoptotic cell death mode characterized by dilation of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and mitochondria, in breast cancer cells. Although the covalent inhibition of thioredoxin reductase (TrxR), an enzyme that critically controls intracellular redox homeostasis, is considered the primary mechanism of AF's anticancer activity, knockdown of TrxR1 did not induce paraptosis. Instead, both TrxR1 knockdown plus the proteasome inhibitor (PI), bortezomib (Bz), and 2 muM AF plus Bz induced paraptosis, thereby mimicking the effect of 5 muM AF. These results suggest that the paraptosis induced by 5 muM AF requires the inhibition of both TrxR1 and proteasome. We found that TrxR1 knockdown/Bz or subtoxic doses of AF and Bz induced paraptosis selectively in breast cancer cells, sparing non-transformed MCF10A cells, whereas 4~5 muM AF killed both cancer and MCF10A cells. GSH depletion was found to be more critical than ROS generation for the paraptosis induced by dual TrxR1/proteasome inhibition. In this process, the ATF4/CHAC1 (glutathione-specific gamma-glutamylcyclotransferase 1) axis leads to GSH degradation, contributing to proteotoxic stress possibly due to the accumulation of misfolded thiol-containing proteins. These results suggest that the paraptosis-inducing strategy of AF plus a PI may provide an effective therapeutic strategy against pro-apoptotic therapy-resistant cancers and reduce the potential side effects associated with high-dose AF."

However, conventional drug discovery focuses on cytotoxic and growth-inhibiting compounds rather than inhibitors of migration. Drug screening assays generally measure the average response of many cells, masking distinct cell populations that drive metastasis and resist treatments. Here, this work presents a high-throughput microfluidic cell migration platform that coordinates robotic liquid handling and computer vision for rapidly quantifying individual cellular motility. Using this innovative technology, 172 compounds were tested and a surprisingly low correlation between migration and growth inhibition was found. Notably, many compounds were found to inhibit migration of most cells while leaving fast-moving subpopulations unaffected. This work further pinpoints synergistic drug combinations, including Bortezomib and Danirixin, to stop fast-moving cells. To explain the observed cell behaviors, single-cell morphological and molecular analysis were performed. These studies establish a novel technology to identify promising migration inhibitors for cancer treatment and relevant applications."

Multidrug therapy is more efficient in such patients compared to monodrug therapy. Simultaneous combinatorial or co-delivery garnered significant interest in the past years. Caffeic acid (CFA) (a natural polyphenol) has received growing attention because of its anticarcinogenic and antioxidant potential. Bortezomib (BTZ) is a proteasome inhibitor and may be explored for treating breast cancer. Despite its high anticancer activity, the low water solubility and chemical instability restrict its efficacy against solid tumors. In the present study, we designed and investigated a HP-PCL (N-2-hydroxypropylmethacrylamide-polycaprolactone) polymeric micellar (PMCs) system for the simultaneous delivery of BTZ and CFA in the treatment of breast cancer. The designed BTZ+CFA-HP-PCL PMCs were fabricated, optimized, and characterized for size, zeta potential, surface morphology, and in vitro drug release. Developed nanosized (174.6 +/- 0.24 nm) PMCs showed enhanced cellular internalization and cell cytotoxicity in both MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells. ROS (reactive oxygen species) levels were highest in BTZ-HP-PCL PMCs, while CFA-HP-PCL PMCs significantly (p < 0.001) scavenged the ROS generated in 2',7'-dichlorofluorescein diacetate (DCFH-DA) assay. The mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) assay revealed intense and significant green fluorescence in both types of cancer cells when treated with BTZ-HP-PCL PMCs (p < 0.001) indicating apoptosis or cell death. The pharmacokinetic studies revealed that BTZ-HP-PCL PMCs and BTZ+CFA-HP-PCL PMCs exhibited the highest bioavailability, enhanced plasma half-life, decreased volume of distribution, and lower clearance rate than the pure combination of drugs. In the organ biodistribution studies, the combination of BTZ+CFA showed higher distribution in the spleen and the heart. Overall findings of in vitro studies surprisingly resulted in better therapeutic efficiency of BTZ-HP-PCL PMCs than BTZ+CFA-HP-PCL PMCs. However, the in vivo tumor growth inhibition study performed in tumor-induced mice concluded that the tumor growth was inhibited by both BTZ-HP-PCL PMCs and BTZ+CFA-HP-PCL PMCs (p < 0.0001) more efficiently than pure BTZ and the combination (BTZ+CFA), which may be due to the conversion of boronate ester into boronic acid. Henceforth, the combination of BTZ and CFA provides further indications to be explored in the future to support the hypothesis that BTZ may work with polyphenol (CFA) in the acidic environment of the tumor."

However, the success of phototheranostic approaches is hampered by the limited tissue penetration depth of near-infrared-I (NIR-I) light (700-900 nm). In this study, a NIR-II (1000-1700 nm) excitation phototheranostic (BTZ/Fe(2+) @BTF/ALD) is presented for NIR-II fluorescence imaging and NIR-II photoacoustic imaging-guided NIR-II photothermal therapy (PTT), chemotherapy, and chemodynamic therapy (CDT) of breast cancer bone metastases. This phototheranostic is developed by integrating a dopamine-modified NIR-II absorbing donor-acceptor-donor small molecule (BBT-FT-DA), the boronate anticancer drug bortezomib (BTZ), and Fe(2+) ions, as CDT catalysts, into an amphiphilic PEGylated phospholipid modified with the bone-targeting ligand alendronate. In acidic and hydrogen peroxide (H(2) O(2) ) over expression tumor microenvironment, the boronate-catechol linkage is cleaved and BTZ and Fe(2+) ions are released to initiate the Fenton reaction, that is, chemotherapy and CDT, respectively, are initialized. It is confirmed using the murine 4T1 bone metastasis model that BTZ/Fe(2+) @BTF/ALD significantly suppresses the progression of tumor cells in the bone tissue via a synergistic NIR-II PTT/chemotherapy/CDT effect. Overall, this work provides fresh insights to guide the development of NIR-II phototheranostics for breast cancer bone metastases."

Upon mTORC1 inhibition, translation of proteins possessing IRES elements in their mRNAs still occurs in order to maintain proper cell function. Thus, inhibitor of apoptosis proteins are expected to be upregulated by mTORC1 inhibition due to the possession of IRES elements. Surprisingly, however, inhibition of mTORC1 with metformin in breast cancer cell lines of MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7, caused the downregulation of IRES-element possessing proteins of cIAP1, XIAP and Bcl-2, 24 h post-treatment. Interestingly, a shorter treatment time of 8 h, however, was accompanied by increased expression of these proteins. Importantly, inclusion of the proteasome inhibitor, Bortezomib, caused the upregulation of the tested anti-apoptotic proteins in both cell lines. These observations suggest that mTORC1 inhibition has a bifold effect; first upregulation of IRES-dependent survival proteins to prevent untimely cell death followed by an opposite effect, which is the enhanced proteosomal degradation of these protein in order to maintain a balanced response."

These malignancies are typically treated with various ErbB2-targeted drugs, but many such cancers develop resistance to these agents and become incurable. Conceivably, treatment of ErbB2-positive cancers could be facilitated by use of agents blocking oncogenic signaling mechanisms downstream of ErbB2. However, current understanding of these mechanisms is limited. The ability of solid tumor cells to resist anoikis, cell death triggered by cell detachment from the extracellular matrix (ECM), is thought to be critical for 3D tumor growth. In an effort to understand the mechanisms of ErbB2-driven breast cancer cell anoikis resistance we found that detachment of non-malignant breast epithelial cells from the ECM upregulates a cell death-promoting tumor suppressor adapter protein BLNK and that ErbB2 blocks this upregulation by reducing tumor cell levels of transcription factor IRF6. We further observed that trastuzumab, a therapeutic anti-ErbB2 antibody, upregulates BLNK in human trastuzumab-sensitive but not trastuzumab-resistant ErbB2-positive breast cancer cells. Moreover, we established that BLNK promotes anoikis by activating p38 MAP kinase and that ErbB2-dependent BLNK downregulation blocks breast cancer cell anoikis. In search for pharmacological approaches allowing to upregulate BLNK in tumor cells we found that clinically approved proteasome inhibitor bortezomib upregulates IRF6 and BLNK in human breast cancer cells and inhibits their 3D growth in a BLNK-dependent manner. In addition, we found that BLNK upregulation in human ErbB2-positive breast cancer cells blocks their ability to form tumors in mice. Furthermore, we used publicly available data on mRNA levels in multiple breast cancers to demonstrate that increased BLNK mRNA levels correlate with increased relapse-free survival in a cohort of approximately 400 patients with ErbB2-positive breast cancer. In summary, we discovered a novel mechanism of ErbB2-driven 3D breast tumor growth mediated by ErbB2-dependent BLNK downregulation."

However, the attempts at inhibiting PIM2 have yielded underwhelming results in early clinical trials on hematological malignancies. Recently, a novel pan‑PIM inhibitor, JP11646, was developed. The present study examined the utility of targeting PIM2 in multiple solid cancers and investigated the antitumor efficacy and the mechanisms of action of JP11646. When PIM2 expression was compared between normal and cancer tissues in publicly available datasets, PIM2 was found to be overexpressed in several types of solid cancers. PIM2 ectopic overexpression promoted tumor growth in in vivo xenograft breast cancer mouse models. The pan‑PIM inhibitor, JP11646, suppressed in vitro cancer cell proliferation in a concentration‑dependent manner in multiple types of cancers; a similar result was observed with siRNA‑mediated PIM2 knockdown, as well as an increased in cell apoptosis. By contrast, another pan‑PIM inhibitor, AZD1208, suppressed the expression of downstream PIM2 targets, but not PIM2 protein expression, corresponding to no apoptosis induction. As a mechanism of PIM2 protein degradation, it was found that the proteasome inhibitor, bortezomib, reversed the apoptosis induced by JP11646, suggesting that PIM2 degradation by JP11646 is proteasome‑dependent. JP11646 exhibited significant anticancer efficacy with minimal toxicities at the examined doses and schedules in multiple in vivo mice xenograft solid cancer models. On the whole, the present study demonstrates that PIM2 promotes cancer progression in solid tumors. JP11646 induces apoptosis at least partly by PIM2 protein degradation and suppresses cancer cell proliferation in vitro and in vivo. JP11646 may thus be a possible treatment strategy for multiple types of solid cancers."

The use of these inhibitors is approved mainly in hematological cancers, and recently many clinical trials and preclinical studies have been conducted on efficacy in solid tumors. Carfilzomib is a second-generation inhibitor and was developed to decrease the side effects of bortezomib. Although there are many valid therapies for breast cancer, resistance and recurrence are inevitable in many cases and the proteasomal system plays an important role in related pathways. OBJECTIVE: This study is a preliminary work to evaluate the combined effects of bortezomib and carfilzomib in four different breast cancer cells. METHODS: MDA-MB-231, MCF-7, UACC-2087, and SKBR-3 cell lines were used. Cell viability was determined using bortezomib and carfilzomib alone and in combination. Combination effect values were determined using the Chou- Talalay method. Apoptosis, proteasome activity, cleaved PARP, and HSP70 expressions were analyzed in the determined doses. RESULTS: The response to the combination of the two inhibitors was different in four cell lines. Apoptosis was significantly higher in combination groups compared to carfilzomib in three cell lines except for SKBR-3, and higher in the combination group compared to bortezomib only in UACC-2087. Combination decreased cleaved PARP levels in MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 and increased SKBR-3 compared to bortezomib. HSP70 levels decreased in combination with UACC-2087 and SKBR-3 compared to carfilzomib. CONCLUSION: Taken together, the combination of the two inhibitors was more apoptotic compared to carfilzomib and apoptosis was higher only in UACC-2087 compared to bortezomib. This apoptosis data can not be directly correlated to the degree of proteasome inhibition, PARP cleavage, and HSP70 response."

Here, we show that the silencing and pharmacological blockade of PSMD14 in MDA-MB 435S breast cancer cells induce paraptosis, a non-apoptotic cell death mode characterized by extensive vacuolation derived from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and mitochondria. The PSMD14 inhibitor, capzimin (CZM), inhibits proteasome activity but differs from the 20S proteasome subunit-inhibiting bortezomib (Bz) in that it does not induce aggresome formation or Nrf1 upregulation, which underlie Bz resistance in cancer cells. In addition to proteasome inhibition, the release of Ca(2+) from the ER into the cytosol critically contributes to CZM-induced paraptosis. Induction of paraptosis by targeting PSMD14 may provide an attractive therapeutic strategy against cancer cells resistant to proteasome inhibitors or pro-apoptotic drugs."

Lymphedema was divided into primary and secondary. The most common secondary factor is malignant tumor, especially breast cancer. We excluded other causes and found no other contributing factors to the patient's massive limb lymphedema apart from multiple myeloma. After one cycle of bortezomib-based chemotherapy, the patient's lymphedema began to resolve and almost completely disappeared after 4 months. As far as we know, this is the first reported case of multiple myeloma patient who developed massive lymphedema. NF-kappaB signaling pathway is the main pathogenesis of multiple myeloma, and closely related with the development of lymphedema. More importantly, the symptom of lymphedema relieved after the treatment of NF-kappaB inhibitor Bortezomib in this patient. Based on the findings of the present study, as well as those of the literature, we proposed NF-kappaB may play an important role in the development of the patient's lymphedema. Further studies are warranted to explain the underlying mechanisms. But this case indicated multiple myeloma may present atypically. We should further examine and clarify the secondary factors of lymphedema, in order to early diagnosis and treatment."

We found that Bz induces ISR, and this can be reversed by ISRIB, a small molecule that restores eIF2B-mediated translation during ISR, in both Bz-sensitive MM cells and Bz-insensitive breast cancer cells. Interestingly, while ISRIB protected MM cells from Bz-induced apoptosis, it enhanced Bz sensitivity in breast cancer cells by inducing paraptosis, the cell death mode that is accompanied by dilation of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and mitochondria. Combined treatment with ISRIB and Bz may shift the fate of Bz-insensitive cancer cells toward paraptosis by inducing translational rescue, leading to irresolvable proteotoxic stress."

We report that TIR-199 is a potent constitutive and immunoproteasome inhibitor, capable of inducing cell death in multiple myeloma, triple-negative breast cancer, (TNBC) and non-small cell lung cancer lines. TIR-199 also effectively inhibits the proteasome in primary myeloma cells of patients, and bypasses the PSMB5 A49T+A50V bortezomib-resistant mutant. TIR-199 treatment leads to accumulation of canonical proteasome substrates in cells, it is specific, and does not inhibit 50 other enzymes tested in vitro. The drug exhibits synergistic cytotoxicity in combination with proteasome-activating kinase DYRK2 inhibitor LDN192960. Furthermore, low-doses of TIR-199 exhibits in vivo activity by delaying myeloma-mediated bone degeneration in a mouse xenograft model.

Targeting the autophagy process could greatly improve chemotherapy outcomes. The discovery of specific inhibitors or activators has been hindered by challenges with reliably measuring autophagy levels in a clinical setting. We investigated drug-induced autophagy in breast cancer cell lines with differing ER/PR/Her2 receptor status by exposing them to known but divergent autophagy inducers each with a unique molecular target, tamoxifen, trastuzumab, bortezomib or rapamycin. Differential gene expression analysis from total RNA extracted during the earliest sign of autophagy flux showed both cell- and drug-specific changes. We analyzed the list of differentially expressed genes to find a common, cell- and drug-agnostic autophagy signature. Twelve mRNAs were significantly modulated by all the drugs and 11 were orthogonally verified with Q-RT-PCR (Klhl24, Hbp1, Crebrf, Ypel2, Fbxo32, Gdf15, Cdc25a, Ddit4, Psat1, Cd22, Ypel3). The drug agnostic mRNA signature was similarly induced by a mitochondrially targeted agent, MitoQ. In-silico analysis on the KM-plotter cancer database showed that the levels of these mRNAs are detectable in human samples and associated with breast cancer prognosis outcomes of Relapse-Free Survival in all patients (RSF), Overall Survival in all patients (OS), and Relapse-Free Survival in ER+ Patients (RSF ER+). High levels of Klhl24, Hbp1, Crebrf, Ypel2, CD22 and Ypel3 were correlated with better outcomes, whereas lower levels of Gdf15, Cdc25a, Ddit4 and Psat1 were associated with better prognosis in breast cancer patients. This gene signature uncovers candidate autophagy biomarkers that could be tested during preclinical and clinical studies to monitor the autophagy process."

Targeting the UPS pathway has emerged as a promising novel treatment in hematological malignancies and solid tumors. OBJECTIVE: This review mainly focuses on the preclinical results of proteasome inhibitors in solid tumors. METHODS: We analyzed the published articles associated with the anticancer results of proteasome inhibitors alone or combination chemotherapy in solid tumors. Important data presented in abstract form were also discussed in this review. RESULTS/CONCLUSION: Proteasome inhibitors, such as bortezomib and carfilzomib, are highly effective in treating solid tumors. The anticancer efficacy is not limited to affect the proteasomal inhibition- associated signaling pathways but also widely involves the signaling pathways related to cell cycle, apoptosis, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). In addition, proteasome inhibitors overcome the conventional chemo-resistance of standard chemotherapeutics by inhibiting signaling pathways, such as NF-kappaB or PI3K/Akt. Combination chemotherapy of proteasome inhibitors and standard chemotherapeutics are widely investigated in multiple relapsed or chemo-resistant solid tumor types, such as breast cancer and pancreatic cancer. The proteasome inhibitors re-sensitize the standard chemotherapeutic regimens and induce synergistic anticancer effects. The development of novel proteasome inhibitors and delivery systems also improves the proteasome inhibitors' anticancer efficacy in solid tumors. This review summarizes the current preclinical results of proteasome inhibitors in solid tumors and reveals the potential anticancer mechanisms."

Currently, the role of TME in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is unclear. This study investigated the correlation between immune-related genes and prognosis in AML patients. METHODS: Transcriptome RNA-Seq data for 151 AML samples were downloaded from TCGA database (https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov/), and the immune related genes (irgs) were selected from Immport database. Bioinformatics screening was used to identify irgs for AML, and genes with a critical role in the prognosis of AML were selected for further analysis. To confirm the prognostic role of irgs in AML, we undertook protein-protein interaction (PPI) network analysis of the top 30 interacting genes. We then investigated associations between immune cell infiltration and prognosis in AML patients. Immunohistochemistry was used to validate protein expression levels between AML and normal bone marrow samples. Analysis of the drug sensitivity of the selected gene was then performed. RESULTS: The integrin lymphocyte function-associated antigen 1 (CD11A/CD18; ITGAL/ITGB2) was identified as the key immune-related gene that significantly influenced prognosis in AML patients. Overexpression of ITGB2 indicated poor prognosis in AML patients (P=0.007). Risk modeling indicated that a high-risk score led to poor outcomes (P=3.076e-08) in AML patients. The risk model showed accuracy for predicting prognosis in AML patients, with area under curve (AUC) at 1 year, 0.816; AUC at 3 years, 0.82; and AUC at 5 years, 0.875. In addition, we found that ITGB2 had a powerful influence on immune cell infiltration into AML TME. The results of immunohistochemistry showed that AML patients had significantly higher ITGB2 protein expression than normal samples. The AML patients were divided into 2 groups based on ITGB2 risk scores. Drug sensitivity test results indicated that the high-risk group was sensitive to cytarabine, axitinib, bosutinib, and docetaxel, but resistant to cisplatin and bortezomib. CONCLUSIONS: In the present study, we found that ITGB2 may be able to serve as a biomarker for assessing prognosis and drug sensitivity in AML patients."

Herein a novel series of pyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidine-based HDAC inhibitors were designed, synthesized and biologically evaluated, among which compounds 7a, 12a1, and 16a1 exhibited potent inhibitory activities and selectivities against HDAC6. Notably, compared with the well-known HDAC6 inhibitor Tubastatin A, our pyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidine-based HDAC6 inhibitors showed superior in vitro antiproliferative activity against human multiple myeloma cell lines RPMI 8226, U266 and MM.1S, while maintaining the low cytotoxicity against human breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231 and two normal cell lines. The HDAC6 selective inhibition of one representative compound 12a1 in RPMI 8226 cells was confirmed by western blot analysis. Although pyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidine is a privileged structure in many kinase inhibitors, compound 12a1 showed negligible inhibition against several kinases including JAK family members and Akt1, indicating its acceptable off-target profile. Besides, compound 12a1 exhibited desirable metabolic stability in mouse liver microsome. The in vivo anti-multiple myeloma potency of 12a1, alone and in combination with bortezomib, was demonstrated in a RPMI 8226 xenograft model."

ErbB2 expression at the cell surface is required for oncogenesis but mechanisms that ensure the optimal cell surface display of overexpressed ErbB2 following its biosynthesis in the endoplasmic reticulum are poorly understood. ErbB2 is dependent on continuous association with HSP90 molecular chaperone for its stability and function as an oncogenic driver. Here, we use knockdown and overexpression studies to show that the HSP90/HSC70-interacting negative co-chaperone CHIP (C-terminus of HSC70-Interacting protein)/STUB1 (STIP1-homologous U-Box containing protein 1) targets the newly synthesized, HSP90/HSC70-associated, ErbB2 for ubiquitin/proteasome-dependent degradation in the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi, thus identifying a novel mechanism that negatively regulates cell surface ErbB2 levels in breast cancer cells, consistent with frequent loss of CHIP expression previously reported in ErbB2-overexpressing breast cancers. ErbB2-overexpressing breast cancer cells with low CHIP expression exhibited higher endoplasmic reticulum stress inducibility. Accordingly, the endoplasmic reticulum stress-inducing anticancer drug Bortezomib combined with ErbB2-targeted humanized antibody Trastuzumab showed synergistic inhibition of ErbB2-overexpressing breast cancer cell proliferation. Our findings reveal new insights into mechanisms that control the surface expression of overexpressed ErbB2 and suggest that reduced CHIP expression may specify ErbB2-overexpressing breast cancers suitable for combined treatment with Trastuzumab and ER stress inducing agents."

To achieve intracellular homeostasis, proteins that are misfolded as a result of translational errors or genetic mutations must be eliminated by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. In our previous publications, we determined that 4T1 breast and B16F10 melanoma cancer cells have differential levels of resistance to proteasome inhibitors. Again, in the previous studies, we reported that 4T1 cell cultures, despite being p53-mutant, underwent apoptosis as a result of bortezomib treatment. The first goal of this study was to verify the resistance levels of parental and resistant PC3 prostate cancer cells to bortezomib using WST-1 test. As a result of treatment with different bortezomib concentrations for 48 h, the IC(50) value of the parental cells was determined as 32.8 nM and that of the resistant cells was determined as 346 nM. This result showed that the resistant cells were at least 10.5 times more resistant. In addition, to determine whether the resistance gained was reversible or not, the cells were passaged in a medium without bortezomib for one month. The IC(50) value determination by WST-1 test showed that the resistant PC3 cells gained an irreversible bortezomib resistance phenotype. The results of the 3D spheroid experiment showed that the 3D spheroid diameter of resistant cells was significantly higher than that of the parental cells. The studies conducted with Western blot showed that ERK1 MAPK T202 phosphorylation and the conversion of autophagy marker LC3-I to LC3-II were significantly increased in parental cells as compared to the resistant cells. Finally, the results showed that while both maternal embryonic leucine zipper kinase (MELK) inhibitor OTSSP167 and Ca(2+) chelator BAPTA-AM (also an inhibitor of the expression of antiapoptotic protein GRP78) are promising agents for cancer cells resistant to the proteasome inhibitors, CDK2 inhibitor CVT-313 was found ineffective in both parental and the resistant cells."

Therefore, blocking cyclin B-proteolysis via additional proteasome (PI) or APC/C-inhibition may have the potential to enhance tumor cell eradication by inducing a more robust mitotic block and mitotic cell death. Here, we analyzed this approach in different cell lines and more physiological patient-derived xenografts (PDX) from lung and breast cancer. The sequential combination of paclitaxel with the PI bortezomib enhanced cell death, but in contrast to the hypothesis during interphase and not in mitosis in both lung and breast cancer. APC/C-inhibition alone or in sequential combination with paclitaxel led to strong mitotic cell death in lung cancer. But in breast cancer, with high expression of the anti-apoptotic regulator Mcl-1, cell death in interphase was induced. Here, combined APC/C- and Mcl-1-inhibition with or without paclitaxel was highly lethal but still resulted in interphase cell death. Taken together, the combination of antimitotic agents with a clinically approved PI or inhibitors of the APC/C and Mcl-1 is a promising approach to improve treatment response in different solid tumors, even though they act entity-dependent at different cell cycle phases."

The proteasome inhibitor bortezomib targets MM cells and improves bone health in MM patients. Radium-223 dichloride (radium-223), the first targeted alpha therapy approved, specifically targets bone metastases, where it disrupts the activity of both tumor cells and tumor-supporting bone cells in mouse models of breast and prostate cancer bone metastasis. We hypothesized that radium-223 and bortezomib combination treatment would have additive effects on MM. In vitro experiments revealed that the combination treatment inhibited MM cell proliferation and demonstrated additive efficacy. In the systemic, syngeneic 5TGM1 mouse MM model, both bortezomib and radium-223 decreased the osteolytic lesion area, and their combination was more effective than either monotherapy alone. Bortezomib decreased the number of osteoclasts at the tumor-bone interface, and the combination therapy resulted in almost complete eradication of osteoclasts. Furthermore, the combination therapy improved the incorporation of radium-223 into MM-bearing bone. Importantly, the combination therapy decreased tumor burden and restored body weights in MM mice. These results suggest that the combination of radium-223 with bortezomib could constitute a novel, effective therapy for MM and, in particular, myeloma bone disease."

Nonetheless, very little is known about its molecular mechanism of action or its downstream target(s). We have previously shown that carnosol inhibits cellular proliferation, migration, invasion, and metastasis as well as triggers autophagy and apoptosis in the highly invasive MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells. Here, we report that carnosol induces histone hypoacetylation in MDA-MB-231 and Hs578T breast cancer cells. We show that, while carnosol does not affect HDACs, it promotes a ROS-dependent proteasome degradation of p300 and PCAF histone acetyl transferases (HATs) without affecting other HATs such as GCN5 and hMOF. Carnosol-induced histone hypoacetylation remains persistent even when p300 and PCAF protein levels were rescued from degradation by (i) the inhibition of the proteasome activity by the proteasome inhibitors MG-132 and bortezomib, and (ii) the inhibition of ROS accumulation by the ROS scavenger, N-acetylcysteine. In addition, we report that, in a cell-free system, carnosol efficiently inhibits histone acetyltransferase activity of recombinant p300 but not that of PCAF or GCN5. Molecular docking studies reveal that carnosol inhibits p300 HAT activity by blocking the entry of the acetyl-CoA binding pocket of the catalytic domain. The superimposition of the docked conformation of the p300 HAT domain in complex with carnosol shows a similar orientation as the p300 structure with acetyl-CoA. Carnosol occupies the region where the pantetheine arm of the acetyl-CoA is bound. This study further confirms carnosol as a promising anti-breast cancer therapeutic compound and identifies it as a novel natural p300 inhibitor that could be added to the existing panel of inhibitors."

HYPOTHESIS: We examined the potential impact of LEE in affecting the activation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) and promoting apoptosis in human multiple myeloma (MM) cells. METHODS: We evaluated the effect of LEE on STAT3 signaling pathway in MM cells by using Western blot analysis and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Thereafter, apoptosis was evaluated using cell cycle analysis and Annexin V assay. RESULTS: We noted that LEE could attenuate the phosphorylation of STAT3 and other up-stream signaling molecules such as JAK1, JAK2, and Src activation in U266 and MM.1S cells. It also diminished STAT3 translocation into the nucleus and enhanced the expression of protein-tyrosine phosphatase epsilon (PTPepsilon). Additionally, LEE caused cell cycle arrest and synergistically augmented the apoptotic actions of bortezomib against MM cells. CONCLUSIONS: Our data indicates that LEE could block STAT3 signaling cascade linked to tumorigenesis and can be used in combination with approved anti-cancer agents in attenuating MM growth and survival."

Anticancer drugs usually kill cells through apoptosis induction and defects in this signaling pathway lead to chemoresistance. Apoptotic protease activating factor 1 regulates cellular stress evoked by chemotherapeutic agents through facilitating apoptosome assembling but can be degraded by proteasome. This study examined the role of proteasome inhibitor Bortezomib in the cytotoxic effects of Docetaxel on MCF7 cells response and its correlation with Apaf-1 expression level. MTT assay, caspase 3/7 activity assay, propidium iodide staining, adenosine triphosphate and reactive oxygen species amount measurements were utilized to demonstrate the role of Bortezomib in Docetaxel efficacy with and without Apaf-1 overexpressing. Meanwhile, two-dimensional cell migration assay was performed by scratch wound assay. The combination of Docetaxel with Bortezomib was significantly more cytotoxic compared single drug, more effectively delayed cell growth, reduced ATP level and increased ROS production. In Apaf-1 overexpressing, Docetaxel was more efficient in preventing cell migration, however, Docetaxel plus Bortezomib were not significantly effective; and fluorescence images supported the interpretation. Our findings demonstrated MCF7 resistance to Docetaxel is due in part to low Apaf-1 level and Apaf-1 overexpression resulted in the increase of cell susceptibility to Docetaxel stimulus. We assume that proteasome inhibitor may restore apoptotic proteins like Apaf-1 and prevent the degradation of cytosolic cytochrome c released by Docetaxel, consequently triggering intrinsic apoptosis and promoting cancer cell death. Collectively, treating MCF7 breast cells with proteasome inhibitor sensitizes cells to Docetaxel-induced apoptosis and possibly overcomes chemoresistance."

While several proteasome inhibitors have been successfully approved by the Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of hematological malignancies, the clinical efficacy of these inhibitors is unexpectedly lower in the treatment of solid tumors due to the functional and structural heterogeneity of proteasomes in solid tumors. There are ongoing trials to examine the effectiveness of compound and novel proteasome inhibitors that can target solid tumors either alone or in combination with conventional chemotherapeutic agents. The modest therapeutic efficacy of proteasome inhibitors such as bortezomib in solid malignancies demands further research to clarify the exact effects of these proteasome inhibitors on different proteasomes present in cancer cells. The structural, cellular localization and functional analysis of the proteasome complexes in solid tumors originated from different tissues provides new insights into the diversity of proteasomes' responses to inhibitors. In this study, we used an optimized iodixanol gradient ultracentrifugation to purify a native form of proteasome complexes with their intact associated protein partners enriched within distinct cellular compartments. It is therefore possible to isolate proteasome subcomplexes with far greater resolution than sucrose or glycerol fractionations. We have identified differences in the catalytic activities, subcellular distribution, and inhibitor sensitivity of cytoplasmic proteasomes isolated from human colon, breast, and pancreatic cancer cell lines. Our developed techniques and generated results will serve as a valuable guideline for investigators developing a new generation of proteasome inhibitors as an effective targeted therapy for solid tumors."

The transcription factor nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB is correlated to the pathogenesis of breast cancer and resistance to therapy. NF-kappaB augments the expression of MDR1 gene, which encodes for the membrane transporter P-glycoprotein (P-gp) in cancer cells. Since NF-kappaB activity is considered to be relatively high in particular when it comes to breast cancer, in the present work, we proposed that the inhibition of NF-kappaB activity can augment and enhance the sensitivity of breast cancer cells to chemotherapy such as doxorubicin (DOX) by virtue of MDR modulation. Our results demonstrated that the DOX-resistant MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 clones exhibit higher NF-kappaB (p65) activity, which is linked to the upregulated expression of ABCB1 and ABCC1 transporter proteins. Combined treatment with NF-kB inhibitors (pentoxifylline and bortezomib) sensitized the resistant breast cancer cells to DOX. Such synergy was compromised by forced overexpression of p65. The DOX/NF-kappaB inhibitor combinations hampered NF-kappaB (p65) activation and downregulated MDR efflux transporters' level. Breast cancer cell migration was sharply suppressed in cells co-treated with DOX/NF-kappaB inhibitors. The same treatments successfully enhanced DOX-mediated induction of apoptosis, which is reflected by the elevated ratio of annexin-V/PI positively stained cells, along with the activation of other apoptotic markers. In conclusion, the data generated from this study provide insights for future translational investigations introducing the use of the clinically approved NF-kappaB inhibitors as an adjuvant in the treatment protocols of resistant breast cancer to overcome the multidrug resistance and enhance the therapeutic outcomes."

More recently, using data-independent acquisition (DIA/SWATH) to systematically measure peptides has gained popularity for its comprehensiveness, reproducibility, and accuracy of quantification. The complementary advantages of these two techniques logically suggests combining them. Here we develop a SILAC-DIA-MS workflow using free, open-source software. We empirically determine that using DIA achieves similar peptide detection numbers as DDA and that DIA improves the quantitative accuracy and precision of SILAC by an order of magnitude. Finally, we apply SILAC-DIA-MS to determine protein turnover rates of cells treated with bortezomib, an FDA-approved 26S proteasome inhibitor for multiple myeloma and mantle cell lymphoma. We observe that SILAC-DIA produces more sensitive protein turnover models. Of the proteins determined to be differentially degraded by both acquisition methods, we find known proteins that are degraded by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, such as HNRNPK, EIF3A, and IF4A1/EIF4A-1, and a slower turnover for CATD, a protein implicated in invasive breast cancer. With improved quantification from DIA, we anticipate that this workflow will make SILAC-based experiments like protein turnover more sensitive."

The primary aims of this two-phase, pre-posttest study were to explore the impact of a CIPN clinician decision support algorithm on clinicians' frequency of CIPN assessment documentation and adherence to evidence-based management. METHODS: One hundred sixty-two patients receiving neurotoxic chemotherapy (e.g., taxanes, platinums, or bortezomib) answered patient-reported outcome measures on CIPN severity and interference prior to three clinic visits at breast, gastrointestinal, or multiple myeloma outpatient clinics (n = 81 usual care phase [UCP], n = 81 algorithm phase [AP]). During the AP, study staff delivered a copy of the CIPN assessment and management algorithm to clinicians (N = 53) prior to each clinic visit. Changes in clinicians' CIPN assessment documentation (i.e., index of numbness, tingling, and/or CIPN pain documentation) and adherence to evidence-based management at the third clinic visit were compared between the AP and UCP using Pearson's chi-squared test. RESULTS: Clinicians' frequency of adherence to evidence-based CIPN management was higher in the AP (29/52 [56%]) than the UCP (20/46 [43%]), but the change was not statistically significant (p = 0.31). There were no improvements in clinicians' CIPN assessment frequency during the AP (assessment index = 0.5440) in comparison to during the UCP (assessment index = 0.6468). CONCLUSIONS: Implementation of a clinician-decision support algorithm did not significantly improve clinicians' CIPN assessment documentation or adherence to evidence-based management.

33304752,Enhanced Protein Damage Clearance Induces Broad Drug Resistance in Multitype of Cancers Revealed by an Evolution Drug-Resistant Model and Genome-Wide siRNA Screening.,"Shao F, Lyu X, Miao K, Xie L, Wang H, Xiao H, Li J, Chen Q, Ding R, Chen P, Xing F, Zhang X, Luo GH, Zhu W, Cheng G, Lon NW, Martin SE, Wang G, Chen G, Dai Y, Deng CX",Adv Sci (Weinh). 2020 Oct 11;7(23):2001914. doi: 10.1002/advs.202001914. eCollection 2020 Dec.,2020 Dec,10.1002/advs.202001914 2001914,7,23,2001914,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33304752,"Resistance to therapeutic drugs occurs in virtually all types of cancers, and the tolerance to one drug frequently becomes broad therapy resistance; however, the underlying mechanism remains elusive. Combining a whole whole-genome-wide RNA interference screening and an evolutionary drug pressure model with MDA-MB-231 cells, it is found that enhanced protein damage clearance and reduced mitochondrial respiratory activity are responsible for cisplatin resistance. Screening drug-resistant cancer cells and human patient-derived organoids for breast and colon cancers with many anticancer drugs indicates that activation of mitochondrion protein import surveillance system enhances proteasome activity and minimizes caspase activation, leading to broad drug resistance that can be overcome by co-treatment with a proteasome inhibitor, bortezomib. It is further demonstrated that cisplatin and bortezomib encapsulated into nanoparticle further enhance their therapeutic efficacy and alleviate side effects induced by drug combination treatment. These data demonstrate a feasibility for eliminating broad drug resistance by targeting its common mechanism to achieve effective therapy for multiple cancers."

Epub 2020 Oct 31.,2021 Jan,S0188-4409(19)30837-9 [pii] 10.1016/j.arcmed.2020.10.002,52,1,48-57,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33131924,"BACKGROUND: Ras-GTPase activating protein SH3-domain-binding proteins (G3BP) are a small family of RNA-binding proteins implicated in regulating gene expression. Changes in expression of G3BPs are correlated to several cancers including thyroid, colon, pancreatic and breast cancer. G3BPs are important regulators of stress granule (SG) formation and function. SG are ribonucleoprotein (RNP) particles that respond to cellular stresses to triage mRNA resulting in transcripts being selectively degraded, stored or translated resulting in a change of gene expression which confers a survival response to the cell. These changes in gene expression contribute to the development of drug resistance. Many RNA viruses, including Chikungunya (and potentially Coronavirus), dismantle SG so that the cell cannot respond to the viral infection. Non-structural protein 3 (nsP3), from the Chikungunya virus, has been shown to translocate G3BP away from SG. Interestingly in cancer cells, the formation of SG is correlated to drug-resistance and blocking SG formation has been shown to reestablish the efficacy of the anticancer drug bortezomib. METHODS: Chikungunya nsP3 was transfected into breast cancer cell lines T47D and MCF7 to disrupt SG formation. Changes in the cytotoxicity of bortezomib were measured. RESULTS: Bortezomib cytotoxicity in breast cancer cell lines changed with a 22 fold decrease in its IC(50) for T47D and a 7 fold decrease for MCF7 cells. CONCLUSIONS: Chikungunya nsP3 disrupts SG formation. As a result, it increases the cytotoxicity of the FDA approved drug, bortezomib. In addition, the increased cytotoxicity appears to correlate to improved bortezomib selectivity when compared to control cell lines."

Following a mastectomy, she underwent reconstruction with a silicone gel breast implant. Three years later, her MGUS had progressed to active multiple myeloma (MM). She had a minimal response after two different regimens of bortezomib-based treatments and monthly zoledronic acid, and was placed on maintenance therapy with bortezomib, intravenous dexamethasone, and oral methylprednisolone, as well as ongoing monthly zoledronic acid. After 1 year of this maintenance therapy, during which her myeloma markers remained unchanged, she had her silicone implant replaced with saline. Despite no change in her myeloma treatment, her laboratory values began to steadily improve following removal of the silicone implant. Her M-protein decreased from 2.14 to 0.83 g/dL and her IgG levels from 3,330 to 1,210 mg/dL following replacement of her silicone implant with saline. To our knowledge, this is the first report in which removal of silicone implants improved the clinical status of a patient with MM following a year of maintenance therapy during which the patient's myeloma laboratory values remained unchanged. Further studies are warranted to determine if silicone breast implant removal can, in fact, improve MM patients' disease status."

This doesn't allow sufficient training of ML classifiers that could be used for improving molecular diagnostics. METHODS: We reviewed published datasets of high throughput gene expression profiles corresponding to cancer patients with known responses on chemotherapy treatments. We browsed Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO), The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Tumor Alterations Relevant for GEnomics-driven Therapy (TARGET) repositories. RESULTS: We identified data collections suitable to build ML models for predicting responses on certain chemotherapeutic schemes. We identified 26 datasets, ranging from 41 till 508 cases per dataset. All the datasets identified were checked for ML applicability and robustness with leave-one-out cross validation. Twenty-three datasets were found suitable for using ML that had balanced numbers of treatment responder and non-responder cases. CONCLUSIONS: We collected a database of gene expression profiles associated with clinical responses on chemotherapy for 2786 individual cancer cases. Among them seven datasets included RNA sequencing data (for 645 cases) and the others - microarray expression profiles. The cases represented breast cancer, lung cancer, low-grade glioma, endothelial carcinoma, multiple myeloma, adult leukemia, pediatric leukemia and kidney tumors.

A growing amount of evidence now indicates that epigenetic changes are also regulated by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. Recent studies indicate that epigenetic regulations are equally crucial for almost all biological processes as well as for pathological conditions such as tumorigenesis, as compared to non-epigenetic control mechanisms (i.e., genetic alterations or classical signal transduction pathways). OBJECTIVE: Here, we reviewed the recent work highlighting the interaction of the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway components (e.g., ubiquitin, E1, E2 and E3 enzymes and 26S proteasome) with epigenetic regulators (histone deacetylases, histone acetyltransferases and DNA methyltransferases). RESULTS: Alterations in the regulation of the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway have been discovered in many pathological conditions. For example, a 2- to 32-fold increase in proteasomal activity and/or subunits has been noted in primary breast cancer cells. Although proteasome inhibitors have been successfully applied in the treatment of hematological malignancies (e.g., multiple myeloma), the clinical efficacy of the proteasomal inhibition is limited in solid cancers. Interestingly, recent studies show that the ubiquitin-proteasome and epigenetic pathways intersect in a number of ways through the regulation of epigenetic marks (i.e., acetylation, methylation and ubiquitylation). CONCLUSION: It is therefore believed that novel treatment strategies involving new generation ubiquitinproteasome pathway inhibitors combined with DNA methyltransferase, histone deacetylase or histone acetyltransferase inhibitors may produce more effective results with fewer adverse effects in cancer treatment as compared to standard chemotherapeutics in hematological as well as solid cancers."
32586194,Differential methylation and expression of genes in the hypoxia-inducible factor 1 signaling pathway are associated with paclitaxel-induced peripheral neuropathy in breast cancer survivors and with preclinical models of chemotherapy-induced neuropathic pain.,"Kober KM, Lee MC, Olshen A, Conley YP, Sirota M, Keiser M, Hammer MJ, Abrams G, Schumacher M, Levine JD, Miaskowski C",Mol Pain. 2020 Jan-Dec;16:1744806920936502. doi: 10.1177/1744806920936502.,2020 Jan-Dec,10.1177/1744806920936502 1744806920936502,16,,1744806920936502,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32586194,"BACKGROUND: Paclitaxel is an important chemotherapeutic agent for the treatment of breast cancer. Paclitaxel-induced peripheral neuropathy (PIPN) is a major dose-limiting toxicity that can persist into survivorship. While not all survivors develop PIPN, for those who do, it has a substantial negative impact on their functional status and quality of life. No interventions are available to treat PIPN. In our previous studies, we identified that the HIF-1 signaling pathway (H1SP) was perturbed between breast cancer survivors with and without PIPN. Preclinical studies suggest that the H1SP is involved in the development of bortezomib-induced and diabetic peripheral neuropathy, and sciatic nerve injury. The purpose of this study was to identify H1SP genes that have both differential methylation and differential gene expression between breast cancer survivors with and without PIPN. METHODS: A multi-staged integrated analysis was performed. In peripheral blood, methylation was assayed using microarray and gene expression was assayed using RNA-seq. Candidate genes in the H1SP having both differentially methylation and differential expression were identified between survivors who received paclitaxel and did (n = 25) and did not (n = 25) develop PIPN. Then, candidate genes were evaluated for differential methylation and differential expression in public data sets of preclinical models of PIPN and sciatic nerve injury. RESULTS: Eight candidate genes were identified as both differential methylation and differential expression in survivors. Of the eight homologs identified, one was found to be differential expression in both PIPN and ""normal"" mice dorsal root ganglia; three were differential methylation in sciatic nerve injury versus sham rats in both pre-frontal cortex and T-cells; and two were differential methylation in sciatic nerve injury versus sham rats in the pre-frontal cortex. CONCLUSIONS: This study is the first to evaluate for methylation in cancer survivors with chronic PIPN. The findings provide evidence that the expression of H1SP genes associated with chronic PIPN in cancer survivors may be regulated by epigenetic mechanisms and suggests genes for validation as potential therapeutic targets."

We found that bortezomib and carfilzomib induce proteotoxic stress and apoptosis via the unfolded protein response (UPR) in TNBC cell lines, with sensitivity correlated with expression of immuno-(PSMB8/9/10) but not constitutive-(PSMB5/6/7) proteasome subunits. Equally, the transcriptomes of i-proteasome-high human TNBCs are enriched with UPR gene sets, and the genomic copy number landscape reflects positive selection pressure favoring i-proteasome activity, but in the setting of adjuvant treatment, this is actually associated with favorable prognosis. Tumor expression of PSMB8 protein (beta5i) is associated with levels of MHC-I, interferon-gamma-inducible proteasome activator PA28beta, and the densities of stromal antigen-presenting cells and lymphocytes (TILs). Crucially, TILs were protective among TNBCs that maintain high beta5i but did not stratify survival amongst beta5i-low TNBCs. Moreover, beta5i expression was lower in brain metastases than in patient-matched primary breast tumors (n = 34; P = 0.007), suggesting that suppression contributes to immune evasion and metastatic progression. Hence, inhibiting proteasome activity could be counterproductive in the adjuvant treatment setting because it potentiates anti-TNBC immunity."

Nano-drug delivery system promised a lot in increasing the patients' compliance and therapeutic efficacy. As a unique nano-carrier, supermolecular aggregation nanovehicle has attracted increasing interests due to the following advantages: announcing drug loading efficacy, pronouncing in vivo performance and simplified production process. METHODS: In this study, the supermolecular aggregation nanovehicle of bortezomib (BTZ) was prepared to treat breast cancer. RESULTS: Although many supermolecular nanovehicles are inclined to disintegrate due to the weak intermolecular interactions among the components, the BTZ supermolecules are satisfying stable. To shed light on the reasons behind this, the forces driving the formation of the nanovehicles were detailed investigated. In other words, the interactions among BTZ and other two components were studied to characterize the nanovehicles and ensure its stability. CONCLUSIONS: Due to the promising tumor targeting ability of the BTZ nanovehicles, the supermolecule displayed promising tumor curing effects and negligible systemic toxicity."

Poor experimental design and lack of scientific transparency may cause experimental biases that in turn affect data quality, robustness and reproducibility. Here, we pinpoint sources of experimental variability in conventional 2D cell-based cancer drug screens to determine the effect of confounders on cell viability for MCF7 and HCC38 breast cancer cell lines treated with platinum agents (cisplatin and carboplatin) and a proteasome inhibitor (bortezomib). Variance component analysis demonstrated that variations in cell viability were primarily associated with the choice of pharmaceutical drug and cell line, and less likely to be due to the type of growth medium or assay incubation time. Furthermore, careful consideration should be given to different methods of storing diluted pharmaceutical drugs and use of DMSO controls due to the potential risk of evaporation and the subsequent effect on dose-response curves. Optimization of experimental parameters not only improved data quality substantially but also resulted in reproducible results for bortezomib- and cisplatin-treated HCC38, MCF7, MCF-10A, and MDA-MB-436 cells. Taken together, these findings indicate that replicability (the same analyst re-performs the same experiment multiple times) and reproducibility (different analysts perform the same experiment using different experimental conditions) for cell-based drug screens can be improved by identifying potential confounders and subsequent optimization of experimental parameters for each cell line."

Epirubicin is known as an anthracycline agent that interferes with DNA and RNA synthesis, and it can be used with other chemotherapeutic drugs in the treatment of post-surgical breast cancer. Epirubicin may have an anti-tumor effect against broad-spectrum tumor cells. However, it is a non-specific chemotherapeutic agent that can cause high toxicity if not used in appropriate doses. Here, we hypothesize that a combination treatment of bortezomib and epirubicin will induce immunogenic cell death in colorectal cancer cells by increasing expression of death receptors such as Fas, which will make these cancer cells more susceptible to Fas/FasL mediated tumor cell killing. Our data demonstrate that a combination of bortezomib and epirubicin significantly increases the sensitivity of colorectal carcinoma cells, but not healthy non-malignant epithelial cells, to apoptosis. The combination treatment significantly upregulates the transcriptional activation of Fas in colorectal cancer cells but not in normal cells. Our results suggest that combining bortezomib and epirubicin may simultaneously enhance tumor immunogenicity and the induction of antitumor immunity."

Study describes a systematic synthetic pathway to synthesize functional polymeric conjugates such as HPMA-Biotin (HP-BT) HPMA-Polylactic acid (HPLA) and HPMA-PLA-Biotin (HPLA-BT) followed by exhaustive characterization both spectroscopically and microscopically. Our strategy yielded polymeric nanoparticles (PNPs) of narrow size range of 199.7 +/- 1.32 nm. Release studies were performed at pH 7.4 and 5.6. PNPs were 2-folds less hemolytic (p < 0.0001) than pure drug. BTZ loaded PNPs of HPLA-BT demonstrated significant anti-cancer activity against MCF-7 cells. IC(50) value of these PNPs was 56.06 +/- 0.12 nM, which was approximately two folds less than BTZ (p < 0.0001). Cellular uptake study confirmed that higher uptake of formulations might be an outcome of biotin surface tethering characteristics that enhanced selectivity and targeting of formulations efficiently. In vivo pharmacokinetics evidenced increased bioavailability (AUC(0 t-infinity)) of DL-HPLA-BT PNPs (drug loaded) than BTZ with an improved half-life. Overall the developed PNPs led to the improved and effective BTZ delivery."

In this chapter, we describe a protocol for the analysis of TNBC cell invasion induced by IL-8 in response to proteasome inhibition by bortezomib (BZ). Using this approach, we show that BZ increases the invasion ability of TNBC cells, and that the BZ-increased TNBC cell invasion is suppressed by IkappaB kinase (IKK) inhibition, which also decreases the IL-8 expression. The experimental protocol includes the cell invasion assay, microscopic evaluation of the invading cells, and quantitative analysis of the obtained images. This protocol should be applicable also for measurement of chemokine-induced tumor cell invasion in other types of cancer cells."

Nanomedicine meditated chemo-photodynamic therapy provides a promising therapeutic opportunity for enhanced cancer therapy. Herein, we constructed an alendronate (ALN)-functionalized bone-seeking nanoagent (BTZ@ZnPc-ALN) to co-deliver the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib (BTZ) and the photosensitizer Zinc phthalocyanine (ZnPc) for synergistic chemo-photodynamic therapy of bone metastases. Results showed that BTZ@ZnPc-ALN possessed favorable bone affinity both in vitro and in vivo and could release drug in a pH-responsive manner. Under irradiation, BTZ@ZnPc-ALN could generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) to cause mitochondrial damage, and increase the cytosolic Ca(2+) levels and the expression of GRP78 protein to induce excessive endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, thereby synergistically inhibiting cell proliferation. More importantly, BTZ@ZnPc-ALN could prolong blood circulation time and preferentially navigate to the bone affected site. As a result, tumor growth was significantly inhibited by bone targeted chemo-photodynamic therapy, with tumor volume cut down by 85% compared with PBS group and bone remained undamaged. Besides, the systemic toxicity of BTZ was significantly reduced. Therefore, the versatile nanoagent is expected to be a promising nanoplatform to concern multiple intracellular stress for remarkable synergistic chemo-photodynamic therapy of bone metastases."

DDZ can display anti-cancer activities against breast and prostate cancers, but its anti-oncogenic actions in multiple myeloma (MM) cells have not been studied. The signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) can control key processes including proliferation, differentiation, and survival in MM cells. Here, we noted that DDZ abrogated STAT3 activation (both constitutive as well as inducible) at Tyr705 and Ser727 in MM cells. Additionally, DDZ mitigated the phosphorylation of STAT3 upstream Janus-activated kinases (JAK1/2) and c-Src kinases. Pervanadate (tyrosine phosphatase blocker) exposure altered the DDZ-induced inhibition of STAT3 activation, thus affecting the action of this phytoestrogen on apoptosis. Moreover, DDZ impeded proliferation and augmented the apoptotic effects of bortezomib (Bor) in MM cells. Overall, the data indicate that DDZ may act as a potent suppressor of STAT3 signaling cascade, and the co-treatment of DDZ and Bor could be a promising therapeutic strategy, specifically in MM."

The therapeutic proteasome inhibitor, bortezomib, successfully targets MM but often leads to drug-resistant disease relapse and fails in breast cancer. Here we show that a 26S proteasome-regulating kinase, DYRK2, is a therapeutic target for both MM and TNBC. Genome editing or small-molecule mediated inhibition of DYRK2 significantly reduces 26S proteasome activity, bypasses bortezomib resistance, and dramatically delays in vivo tumor growth in MM and TNBC thereby promoting survival. We further characterized the ability of LDN192960, a potent and selective DYRK2-inhibitor, to alleviate tumor burden in vivo. The drug docks into the active site of DYRK2 and partially inhibits all 3 core peptidase activities of the proteasome. Our results suggest that targeting 26S proteasome regulators will pave the way for therapeutic strategies in MM and TNBC."

The bioactive sphingolipid metabolite sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) regulates numerous processes important for cancer progression, metastasis, and neuropathic pain. The pro-drug FTY720 (fingolimod, Gilenya) used to treat multiple sclerosis is phosphorylated in the body to a S1P mimic that binds to S1PRs, except S1PR2, and also acts as a functional antagonist of S1PR1. This review highlights current findings showing that FTY720 has multiple anti-cancer activities and simultaneously prevents formation and actions of S1P. Moreover, in mouse breast cancer models, treatment with FTY720 reduces tumor growth, metastasis, and enhances sensitivity of advanced and hormonal refractory breast cancer and TNBC to conventional therapies. We discuss recent studies demonstrating that neuropathic pain induced by the chemotherapeutic bortezomib is also greatly reduced by administration of clinically relevant doses of FTY720, likely by targeting S1PR1 on astrocytes. FTY720 also shows promising anticancer potential in pre-clinical studies and is FDA approved, thus we suggest in this review that further studies are needed to pave the way for fast-tracking approval of FTY720/fingolimod for enhancing chemotherapy effectiveness and reduction of painful neuropathies."

Thus, the development of alternative therapeutic strategies is urgently needed for patients who failed lapatinib treatment. Proteasome inhibitors have been reported to possess high anti-tumor activity to breast cancer cells. Therefore, this study aims to examine whether and how proteasome inhibitor bortezomib can overcome lapatinib resistance. Treatments with several proteasome inhibitors, including Bortezomib, MG132, and proteasome inhibitor I (PSI), as well as the viabilities of both HER2-positive breast cancer cell lines and their lapatinib-resistant clones, were inhibited. Importantly, the expressions of ErbB family were downregulated at both transcriptional and translational levels. Also, our results further indicated that proteasome inhibitors decreased ErbB family expression through lysosomal degradation pathway in a heat shock protein 90 (HSP90)-dependent manner. In this study, our data supported a potential approach to overcome the acquired resistance of HER2-overexpressing breast cancer patients to lapatinib using proteasome inhibitors."

BTZ's aqueous in solubility is the main hindrance in its successful development as a commercial formulation. The main objective of the present study is to develop and characterize folic acid-glycine-poly-L-lactic acid (FA-Gly(4)-PLA) based nanoformulation (NPs) to improve solubility and efficacy of BTZ. METHODS: BTZ loaded FA-Gly(4)-PLA NPs were prepared and characterized for size, zeta potential, in vitro studies such as release, kinetics modeling, hemolytic toxicity, and cell line-based studies (Reactive Oxygen Species: ROS and cytotoxicity). RESULTS: BTZ loaded NPs (BTZ-loaded FA-Gly(4)-PLA) and blank NPs (FA-Gly(4)-PLA) size, zeta, and PDI were found to be 110 +/- 8.1 nm, 13.7 +/- 1.01 mV, 0.19 +/- 0.03 and 198 +/- 9.01 nm, 8.63 +/- 0.21 mV, 0.21 +/- 0.08 respectively. The percent encapsulation efficiency (% EE) and percent drug loading (% DL) of BTZ loaded FA-Gly(4)-PLA NPs was calculated to be 78.3 +/- 4.1 and 12.38 +/- 2.1. The Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) showed that NPs were slightly biconcave in shape. The in vitro release of BTZ from FA-Gly(4)-PLA NPs resulted in the sustained manner. The prepared NPs were less hemolytic than BTZ. CONCLUSIONS: BTZ loaded Gly(4)-PLA NPs apoptotic index was found to be much higher than BTZ but lesser than BTZ loaded FA-Gly(4)-PLA against breast cancer cell lines (MDA-MB-231). ROS intracellular assessment assay indicated that BTZ and BTZ loaded FA-Gly(4)-PLA NPs exhibited higher ROS production. Conclusively, the BTZ loaded FA-Gly(4)-PLA NPs were able to encapsulate more BTZ than BTZ loaded Gly(4)-PLA NPs and were found to be more effective as per as in vitro anti-cancer effect is concerned."

In the present study, we evaluated the ability of carnosol to inhibit tumor growth and metastasis in vivo. We found that non-cytotoxic concentrations of carnosol inhibited the migration and invasion of MDA-MB-231 cells in wound healing and matrigel invasion assays. Furthermore, gelatin zymography, ELISA, and RT-PCR assays revealed that carnosol inhibited the activity and downregulation the expression of MMP-9. Mechanistically, we demonstrated that carnosol suppressed the activation of STAT3 signaling pathway through a ROS-dependent targeting of STAT3 to proteasome-degradation in breast cancer cells (MDA-MB-231, Hs578T, MCF-7, and T47D). We show that blockade of proteasome activity, by MG-132 and bortezomib, or ROS accumulation, by N-acetylcysteine (NAC), restored the level of STAT3 protein. In addition, using chick embryo tumor growth assay, we showed that carnosol significantly and markedly suppressed tumor growth and metastasis of breast cancer xenografts. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report which shows that carnosol specifically targets signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) for proteasome degradation in breast cancer. Our study further provide evidence that carnosol may represent a promising therapeutic candidate that canmodulate breast cancer growth and metastasis."

Here, protein expression profiling was performed by HiRIEF-LC-MS in 14 primary SI-NETs from patients with and without liver metastases detected at the time of surgery and initial treatment. Among differentially expressed proteins, overexpression of the ubiquitin-like protein NEDD8 was identified in samples from patients with liver metastasis. Further, NEDD8 correlation analysis indicated co-expression with RBX1, a key component in cullin-RING ubiquitin ligases (CRLs). In vitro inhibition of neddylation with the therapeutic agent pevonedistat (MLN4924) resulted in a dramatic decrease of proliferation in SI-NET cell lines. Subsequent mass spectrometry-based proteomics analysis of pevonedistat effects and effects of the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib revealed stabilization of multiple targets of CRLs including p27, an established tumor suppressor in SI-NET. Silencing of NEDD8 and RBX1 using siRNA resulted in a stabilization of p27, suggesting that the cellular levels of NEDD8 and RBX1 affect CRL activity. Inhibition of CRL activity, by either NEDD8/RBX1 silencing or pevonedistat treatment of cells resulted in induction of apoptosis that could be partially rescued by siRNA-based silencing of p27. Differential expression of both p27 and NEDD8 was confirmed in a second cohort of SI-NET using immunohistochemistry. Collectively, these findings suggest a role for CRLs and the ubiquitin proteasome system in suppression of p27 in SI-NET, and inhibition of neddylation as a putative therapeutic strategy in SI-NET."

Here we showed that SOX7 was significantly downregulated in different cancer types, especially in lung and breast cancers. Low expression of SOX7 was associated with advantage stage of cancer with shorter overall survival. Cancer cells with loss of SOX7 promoted cell survival and colony formation, suppressed cellular apoptosis and produced a drug resistant phenotype against a variety of chemo/targeting therapeutic agents. Mechanistically, SOX7 induced cellular apoptosis through upregulation of genes associated with both P38 and apoptotic signaling pathway, as well as preventing the proteasome mediated degradation of pro-apoptotic protein BIM. Treatment of either a proteasome inhibitor MG132 or bortezomib, or with a p-ERK/MEK inhibitor U0126 attenuate the SOX7 promoted BIM degradation. We identified Panobinostat, an FDA approved pan-HDAC inhibitor, could elevate and restore SOX7 expression in SOX7 silenced lung cancer cells. Taken together, these data revealed an unappreciated role of SOX7 in regulation of cellular apoptosis through control of MAPK/ERK-BIM signaling."

To identify TNBC therapeutic targets, we performed integrative bioinformatics analysis of multiple breast cancer patient-derived gene expression datasets and focused on kinases with FDA-approved or in-pipeline inhibitors. Sphingosine kinase 1 (SPHK1) was identified as a top candidate. SPHK1 overexpression or downregulation in human TNBC cell lines increased or decreased spontaneous metastasis to lungs in nude mice, respectively. SPHK1 promoted metastasis by transcriptionally upregulating the expression of the metastasis-promoting gene FSCN1 via NFkappaB activation. Activation of the SPHK1/NFkappaB/FSCN1 signaling pathway was associated with distance metastasis and poor clinical outcome in patients with TNBC. Targeting SPHK1 and NFkappaB using clinically applicable inhibitors (safingol and bortezomib, respectively) significantly inhibited aggressive mammary tumor growth and spontaneous lung metastasis in orthotopic syngeneic TNBC mouse models. These findings highlight SPHK1 and its downstream target, NFkappaB, as promising therapeutic targets in TNBC. SIGNIFICANCE: SPHK1 is overexpressed in TNBC and promotes metastasis, targeting SPHK1 or its downstream target NFkappaB with clinically available inhibitors could be effective for inhibiting TNBC metastasis."

The biomimetic peptide was designed with a fluorescent molecule fluorescein isothiocyanate for imaging, a RGD sequence for cancer-targeting and tetravalent catechol groups for dynamic conjugation of the antitumor drug bortezomib via pH-cleavable boronic acid-catechol esters. Our study demonstrated that the peptide-based prodrug nanocarrier dramatically the enhanced specific cellular uptake and cytotoxicity toward human breast cancer cells in vitro in comparison with free drug and nontargeting control nanoparticles. Likewise, the prodrug nanocarrier showed improved therapeutic efficacy and low systematic toxicity in vivo. Considering highly biomimetic nature of the peptide-based nanocarriers, rapid drug release from the dynamically conjugated prodrugs, and convenience of introducing cancer-targeting activity onto this nanosystem, we believe our work would provide new ideas for the development of intelligent and biocompatible drug delivery systems to improve the chemotherapy efficacy in clinic. Furthermore, the pH-sensitive drug conjugation mechanism on peptide-based nanocarriers would provide a hint for the exploitation of dynamic prodrug strategies and the development of highly biocompatible nanocarriers using biogenic materials, e.g., the proteinogenic nanomaterials decorated with drugs through dynamic covalent chemistry."

In this way they might influence whether a cell is sensitive or resistant to a certain drug. So far, only a limited number of relatively small scale studies comprising few cell lines and/or drugs have been performed. To obtain a broader view on miRNAs and their association with drug response, we investigated the expression levels of 411 miRNAs in relation to drug sensitivity in 36 breast cancer cell lines. For this purpose IC50 values of a drug screen involving 34 drugs were associated with miRNA expression data of the same breast cancer cell lines. Since molecular subtype of the breast cancer cell lines is considered a confounding factor in drug association studies, multivariate analysis taking subtype into account was performed on significant miRNA-drug associations which retained 13 associations. These associations consisted of 11 different miRNAs and eight different drugs (among which Paclitaxel, Docetaxel and Veliparib). The taxanes, Paclitaxel and Docetaxel, were the only drugs having miRNAs in common: hsa-miR-187-5p and hsa-miR-106a-3p indicative of drug resistance while Paclitaxel sensitivity alone associated with hsa-miR-556-5p. Tivantinib was associated with hsa-let-7d-5p and hsa-miR-18a-5p for sensitivity and hsa-miR-637 for resistance. Drug sensitivity was associated with hsa-let-7a-5p for Bortezomib, hsa-miR-135a-3p for JNJ-707 and hsa-miR-185-3p for Panobinostat. Drug resistance was associated with hsa-miR-182-5p for Veliparib and hsa-miR-629-5p for Tipifarnib. Pathway analysis for significant miRNAs was performed to reveal biological roles, aiding to find a potential mechanistic link for the observed associations with drug response. By doing so hsa-miR-187-5p was linked to the cell cycle G2-M checkpoint in line with this checkpoint being the target of taxanes. In conclusion, our study shows that miRNAs could potentially serve as biomarkers for intrinsic drug resistance and that pathway analyses can provide additional information in this context."

The cytotoxicity of these compounds was determined using three breast tumor cell lines (MDA-MB231, MDA-MB468 and MCF7) and two matching non-cancer breast epithelial cell lines (184B5 and MCF10A). Although most of the compounds were quite effective on the breast cancer cells, the compound 7-chloro-4-(4-(2,4-dinitrophenylsulfonyl)piperazin-1-yl)quinoline (13; VR23) emerged as potentially the most desirable one in this series of compounds. Data from the NCI-60 cancer panel screening show that compound 13 is effective on a wide range of different cancers. Importantly, compound 13 is needed up to 17.6-fold less doses to achieve the same IC(50) against cancer than non-cancer cells (MDA-MB468 vs MCF10A), suggesting that it can potentially be less toxic to normal cells. Cancer cells formed multiple centrosomes in the presence of compound 13, resulting in the cell cycle arrest at prometa-meta phase. This abnormality leads to eventual cell demise with sub-G1 DNA content typically shown with apoptotic cells. In addition, compound 13 also causes an increase in lysosomal volume in cancer but not in non-cancer cells, which may contribute at least in part to its preferential cancer cell-killing. The cancer cell-killing effect of compound 13 is highly potentiated when combined with either bortezomib or monastrol."

We investigated whether a nanocrystal (NC) formulation can address these issues and enhance anticancer efficacy of CFZ against breast cancer. The surface of NC was coated with albumin in order to enhance the formulation stability and drug delivery to tumors via interactions with albumin-binding proteins located in and near cancer cells. The novel albumin-coated NC formulation of CFZ (CFZ-alb NC) displayed improved metabolic stability and enhanced cellular interactions, uptake and cytotoxic effects in breast cancer cells in vitro. Consistently, CFZ-alb NC showed greater anticancer efficacy in a murine 4T1 orthotopic breast cancer model than the currently used cyclodextrin-based formulation. Overall, our results demonstrate the potential of CFZ-alb NC as a viable formulation for breast cancer therapy."

TP53 and MGMT function is affected by several pathologic mechanisms, such as point mutations or promoter methylation, which are well characterized. Expression of both genes can be regulated by other mechanisms as well, e.g., microRNAs (miRNAs). Moreover, cross-talk among various pathologic processes may occur, further affecting MGMT and TP53 functionality. MATERIAL AND METHODS: In 49 GB patients, we analyzed the possible associations between TP53 and its miRNA regulators miR-125b, miR-21, and miR-34a, as well as MGMT and its miRNA regulators miR-181d and miR-648. We evaluated the possible influence of mutational and methylation status on the pre-identified associations. RESULTS: In patients with immunohistochemistry-detected TP53 overexpression, expression levels of miR-34a and TP53 were negatively correlated (r = -0.56, p = 0.0195), and in patients with TP53 mutations, expression levels of TP53 and miR-21 were negatively correlated (r = -0.67, p = 0.0330).

Most newly synthesized compounds displayed high inhibition rates toward HDAC at the concentration of 1 muM.

Furthermore, compounds LYP-2, LYP-3, and LYP-6 potently inhibited the activity of HDAC6 with selectivity over HDAC1. We chose LYP-2 and LYP-6 to test its antiproliferative effect on breast cancer cells MCF-7. Either LYP-2 or LYP-6 alone moderately suppressed the cell growth, but could synergistically enhance the inhibitory effect of bortezomib. These results suggested that combined HDAC6 inhibitor and bortezomib regimen might be an option for breast cancer treatment."

The molecular basis of BTZ resistance in breast cancer remains elusive. In the present study, we found that cellular O-GlcNAc modification was dramatically elevated by BTZ treatment in intrinsic resistant MCF-7 and T47D cells, but not in sensitive MDA-MB-231 cells. A progressive increase in O-GlcNAcylation characterized the increased acquired resistance of MDA-MB-231-derived cells. We showed that elevated O-GlcNAc subsequently modified breast cancer related pioneer factor FOXA1 and reduced its protein stability. Further, we demonstrated that FOXA1 attenuation was involved in transcriptional downregulation of proapoptotic Bim and thus suppressed breast cancer cell apoptosis. Finally, the combination of O-GlcNAc inhibitor L01 to BTZ sensitized resistant cells. Our results have revealed a new regulatory mechanism that involves O-GlcNAc elevation mediated Bim deficiency, which plays a key role in the apoptotic dysregulation and BTZ resistance in breast cancer cells."

Although the survival rate of patients with MM has improved in the past decade, most people inevitably relapse. The treatment and prognosis of MM are still urgent problems. Breast Cancer Antiestrogen Resistance 3 (BCAR3) is a protein-coding gene that is associated with many tumors. However, there have been few studies on the relationship of BCAR3 and MM. METHODS: We analyzed 1878 MM patients (1930 samples) from 7 independent datasets. First, we compared the BCAR3 expression level of MM patients in different stages and MM patients with different amplification of 1q21. Second, we analyzed BCAR3 expression levels in MM patients with different molecular subtypes. Finally, we explored the event-free survival rate (EFS) and overall survival rate (OS) of MM patients with high or low BCAR3 expression, including patients before and after relapse, and their therapeutic responses to bortezomib and dexamethasone. RESULTS: The expression of BCAR3 showed a decreasing trend in stages I, II and III (P = 0.00068). With the increase of 1q21 amplification level, the expression of BCAR3 decreased (P = 0.022). Patients with high BCAR3 expression had higher EFS and OS (EFS: P < 0.0001, OS: P < 0.0001). The expression of BCAR3 gene before relapse was higher than that after relapse (P = 0.0045). BCAR3 is an independent factor affecting prognosis (EFS: P = 5.17E-03; OS: P = 3.33E-04). CONCLUSION: We found that high expression level of BCAR3 predicted better prognosis of MM patients. Low expression of BCAR3 at diagnosis can predict early relapse. BCAR3 is an independent prognostic factor for MM. BCAR3 can be used as a potential biomarker."

Interfering with these mechanisms may overcome the resistance to doxorubicin, a still unmet need in TNBC. METHODS: We analyzed a panel of human and murine breast cancer cells for their resistance to doxorubicin, Pgp expression, lysosome and proteasome activity, nitrite production, ER-dependent cell death and immunogenic cell death parameters. We evaluated the efficacy of genetic (C/EBP-beta LIP induction) and pharmacological strategies (lysosome and proteasome inhibitors), in restoring the ER-dependent and immunogenic-dependent cell death induced by doxorubicin, in vitro and in syngeneic mice bearing chemoresistant TNBC. The results were analyzed by one-way analysis of variance test. RESULTS: We found that TNBC cells characterized by high levels of Pgp and resistance to doxorubicin, had low induction of the ER-dependent pro-apoptotic factor C/EBP-beta LIP upon doxorubicin treatment and high activities of lysosome and proteasome that constitutively destroyed LIP. The combination of chloroquine and bortezomib restored doxorubicin sensitivity by activating multiple and interconnected mechanisms. First, chloroquine and bortezomib prevented C/EBP-beta LIP degradation and activated LIP-dependent CHOP/TRB3/caspase 3 axis in response to doxorubicin. Second, C/EBP-beta LIP down-regulated Pgp and up-regulated calreticulin that triggered the dendritic cell (DC)-mediated phagocytosis of tumor cell, followed by the activation of anti-tumor CD8(+)T-lymphocytes upon doxorubicin treatment. Third, chloroquine and bortezomib increased the endogenous production of nitric oxide that further induced C/EBP-beta LIP and inhibited Pgp activity, enhancing doxorubicin's cytotoxicity. In orthotopic models of resistant TNBC, intratumor C/EBP-beta LIP induction - achieved by a specific expression vector or by chloroquine and bortezomib - effectively reduced tumor growth and Pgp expression, increased intra-tumor apoptosis and anti-tumor immune-infiltrate, rescuing the efficacy of doxorubicin. CONCLUSIONS: We suggest that preventing C/EBP-beta LIP degradation by lysosome and proteasome inhibitors triggers multiple virtuous circuitries that restore ER-dependent apoptosis, down-regulate Pgp and re-activate the DC/CD8(+)T-lymphocytes response against TNBC. Lysosome and proteasome inhibitors associated with doxorubicin may overcome the resistance to the drug in TNBC."

Therefore, understanding how resistance can be prevented, targeted and predicted becomes increasingly important to improve cancer therapy. In the last decade, it has become apparent that alterations in cellular metabolism are a hallmark of cancer cells and that a rewired metabolism is essential for rapid tumor growth and proliferation. Recently, metabolic alterations have been shown to play a role in the sensitivity of cancer cells to widely-used first-line chemotherapeutics. This suggests that metabolic pathways are important mediators of resistance toward anticancer agents. In this review, we highlight the metabolic alterations associated with resistance toward different anticancer agents and discuss how metabolism may be exploited to overcome drug resistance to classical chemotherapy."

It is up-regulated in several types of malignant cancers. Neurotransmitter transporters of the SLC6 family interact with specific SEC24 proteins of the COPII complex along their pathway from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to Golgi. This study focused on the possible role of SEC24 proteins in ATB(0,+) trafficking. Rat ATB(0,+) was expressed in HEK293 cells, its localization and trafficking were examined by Western blot, deglycosylation, immunofluorescence (co-localization with ER and trans-Golgi markers) and biotinylation. The expression of ATB(0,+) at the plasma membrane was decreased by dominant negative mutants of SAR1, a GTPase, whose activity triggers the formation of the COPII complex. ATB(0,+) co-precipitated with SEC24C (but not with the remaining isoforms A, B and D). This interaction was confirmed by immunocytochemistry and the proximity ligation assay. Co-localization of SEC24C with endogenous ATB(0,+) was also observed in MCF-7 breast cancer cells. Contrary to the endogenous transporter, part of the overexpressed ATB(0,+) is directed to proteolysis, a process significantly reversed by a proteasome inhibitor bortezomib. Co-transfection with a SEC24C dominant negative mutant attenuated ATB(0,+) expression at the plasma membrane, due to proteolytic degradation. These results support a hypothesis that lysine at position +2 downstream of the ER export ""RI"" motif on the cargo protein is crucial for SEC24C binding and for further trafficking to the Golgi. Moreover, there is an equilibrium between ER export and degradation mechanisms in case of overexpressed transporter."

In this study, we developed a tripeptide Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD)-targeted dendrimer conjugated with catechol and poly(ethylene glycol) groups for the targeted delivery of bortezomib to metastatic bone tumors. Bortezomib was loaded on the dendrimer via a boronate-catechol linkage with pH-responsive property, which plays an essential role in the control of bortezomib loading and release. The nontargeted bortezomib nanomedicine showed minimal cytotoxicity at pH 7.4, but significantly increased anticancer activity when cyclic RGD (cRGD) moieties were anchored on the dendrimer surface. The ligand cRGD enabled efficient internalization of the bortezomib complex by breast cancer cells such as MDA-MB-231 cells. The targeted nanomedicine efficiently depressed the progression of metastatic bone tumors and significantly inhibited the tumor-associated osteolysis in a model of bone tumors. This study provided an insight into the development of nanomedicine for metastatic bone tumors."

Up to now, no targeted treatment beyond anti-VEGF therapy has been approved for TNBC and cytotoxic agents remain the mainstay of treatment. Ixazomib is a selective and reversible inhibitor of the proteasome, which has been mainly investigated in the treatment of multiple myeloma. In a preclinical study TNBC cells were treated with the first-generation proteasome inhibitor bortezomib in combination with cisplatin and synergistic efficacy was demonstrated. Clinical data are available for carboplatin plus bortezomib in metastatic ovarian and lung cancers showing remarkable antitumor activity and good tolerability (Mol Cancer 11:26 2012, J Thorac Oncol 4:87-92 2009, J Thorac Oncol 7:1032-1040, 2012). Based on this evidence, the phase I/II MBC-10 trial will evaluate the toxicity profile and efficacy of the second-generation proteasome inhibitor ixazomib in combination with carboplatin in patients with advanced TNBC. METHODS: Patients with metastatic TNBC pretreated with at least one prior line of chemotherapy for advanced disease with a confirmed disease progression and measurable disease according to RECIST criteria 1.1 are eligible for this study. Patients will receive ixazomib in combination with carboplatin on days 1, 8, and 15 in a 28-day cycle. The phase I part of this study utilizes an alternate dose escalation accelerated titration design. After establishing the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), the efficacy and safety of the combination will be further evaluated (phase II, including 41 evaluable patients). All patients will continue on study drugs until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity or discontinuation for any other reason. Primary endpoint of the phase II is overall response rate, secondary endpoints include progression-free survival, safety, and quality of life. This trial is open for patient enrollment since November 2016 in six Austrian cancer centers. Accrual is planned to be completed within 2 years. DISCUSSION: Based on preclinical and clinical findings an ixazomib and carboplatin combination is thought to be effective in metastatic TNBC patients. The MBC-10 trial is accompanied by a broad biomarker program investigating predictive biomarkers for treatment response and potential resistance mechanisms to the investigational drug combination.

When neuropathic pain is severe, patients often either switch to less-effective chemotherapy agents or choose to discontinue chemotherapy entirely. Conventional chemotherapy drugs used to treat lung and breast cancer, multiple myeloma, and lymphoma include paclitaxel, vincristine, and bortezomib. Approximately 68% of patients receiving these anticancer drugs develop neuropathy within the first month of treatment, and while strategies to prevent chemotherapy-induced neuropathy have been investigated, none have yet been proven as effective. Recent reports suggest that chemotherapy-induced neuropathy is associated with signal transduction molecules, including protein kinase C and mitogen-activated protein kinases. It is currently unclear whether protein kinase C inhibition can prevent chemotherapy-induced neuropathy. In this study, we found that tamoxifen, a protein kinase C inhibitor, suppressed paclitaxel-, vincristine-, and bortezomib-induced cold and mechanical allodynia in mice. In addition, chemotherapy drugs induce neuropathy via the protein kinase C/extracellular signal-regulated kinase pathway in the spinal cord in lumbar segments 4-6 and dorsal root ganglions. In addition, tamoxifen was shown to act synergistically with paclitaxel to inhibit tumor-growth in mice injected with tumor cells. Our results indicated that paclitaxel-, vincristine-, and bortezomib-induced neuropathies were associated with the protein kinase C/extracellular signal-regulated kinase pathway in the lumbar spinal cord and dorsal root ganglions, which suggest that protein kinase C inhibitors may be therapeutically effective for the prevention of chemotherapy-induced neuropathy when administered with standard chemotherapy agents."

The activity of ULK1 is tightly regulated by several post-translational modifications, including ubiquitination, yet the deubiquitinase (DUB) responsible for its reversible deubiquitination has not been described. Here, we identified USP1 (ubiquitin specific peptidase 1) as a key player in the modulation of ULK1 K63-linked deubiquitination. Moreover, both USP1 depletion and its chemical inhibition by pimozide are coupled to a reduction of ULK1 in Triton X-100 soluble cellular lysates, and its compartmentalization to a fraction that can be solubilized in 5 M urea. In USP1-depleted cells this fraction is also enriched in SQSTM1 (sequestosome 1), the aggresome marker HDAC6 (histone deacetylase 6), and the prototype of USP1 targets FANCD2 (FA complementation group D2). Consistently, in USP1-depleted and pimozide-treated cells, ULK1 forms protein aggregates enriched in SQSTM1, as detected by both immummunofluorescence and co-immunoprecipitation studies. Notably, depletion of USP1 inhibits canonical autophagic flux and promotes an alternative route leading to lysosomal-mediated degradation of SQSTM1. Our findings reveal a novel function of the USP1-ULK1 axis as a modulator of the switch between canonical and unconventional autophagy. Further, we provide the first evidence supporting the existence of a subset of breast tumors co-expressing ULK1 and MAP1LC3B (microtubule associated protein 1 light chain 3 beta) proteins. Because the USP1 inhibitor pimozide affects breast cancer cell growth, targeting USP1 in those tumors relying on autophagy for growth might prove to be a convenient therapeutic strategy.

Bone metastasis is one of the most common pathways in the metastasis of breast cancer, and it is also an important cause for tumor recurrence and death. The aryl boronate group, as an acid-labile linker, has been introduced into nano-assemblies in recent years. Especially, as a proteasome inhibitor anticancer drug with a boric acid group, bortezomib can facilitate the formation of pH-sensitive aryl boric acid ester linkage with the catecholic group. In this study, bortezomib-loaded micelles with bone targeting properties were constructed for the treatment of breast cancer bone metastasis. The mixed micelles employed alendronate (ALN) as the bone-targeting ligand and encapsulated bortezomib-catechol conjugates as the cargo. In vitro and in vivo studies showed that compared with free drugs or control micelles, these prodrug micelles (ALN-NP) exhibited many favorable properties such as reduced systemic toxicity and improved therapeutic effects. Therefore, ALN-NP is promising as a nanovehicle for bone-targeting delivery of chemotherapeutic drugs. Furthermore, this study offers a novel strategy combining bone targeting and aryl boronate-based pH-responsive drug release for anti-metastasis therapy."

The expression of ERalpha is regarded as a major prognostic marker, making it a meaningful target to treat breast cancer (BCa). However, hormone receptor-positive BCa was sometimes irresponsive or even resistant to classic anti-hormonal therapies (e.g., fulvestrant and tamoxifen). Hence, novel anti-endocrine therapies are urgent for ERalpha(+) BCa. A phase II study suggested that bortezomib, an inhibitor blocking the activity of 20 S proteasomes, intervenes in cancer progression for anti-endocrine therapy in BCa. Here we report that proteasome-associated deubiquitinases (USP14 and UCHL5) inhibitors b-AP15 and platinum pyrithione (PtPT) induce growth inhibition in ERalpha(+) BCa cells. Further studies show that these inhibitors induce cell cycle arrest and apoptosis associated with caspase activation, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and the downregulation of ERalpha. Moreover, we suggest that b-AP15 and PtPT block ERalpha signaling via enhancing the ubiquitin-mediated degradation of ERalpha and inhibiting the transcription of ERalpha. Collectively, these findings demonstrate that proteasome-associated deubiquitinases inhibitors b-AP15 and PtPT may have the potential to treat BCa resistant to anti-hormonal therapy."

Because TNBC patients are unresponsive to current targeted therapies, new therapeutic strategies are urgently needed. While proteasome inhibition by bortezomib (BZ) or carfilzomib (CZ) has been effective in treating hematological malignancies, it has been less effective in solid tumors, including TNBC, but the mechanisms are incompletely understood. Here we report that proteasome inhibition significantly increases expression of IL-8, and its receptors CXCR1 and CXCR2, in TNBC cells. Suppression or neutralization of the BZ-induced IL-8 potentiates the BZ cytotoxic and anti-proliferative effect in TNBC cells. The IL-8 expression induced by proteasome inhibition in TNBC cells is mediated by IkappaB kinase (IKK), increased nuclear accumulation of p65 NFkappaB, and by IKK-dependent p65 recruitment to IL-8 promoter. Importantly, inhibition of IKK activity significantly decreases proliferation, migration, and invasion of BZ-treated TNBC cells. These data provide the first evidence demonstrating that proteasome inhibition increases the IL-8 signaling in TNBC cells, and suggesting that IKK inhibitors may increase effectiveness of proteasome inhibitors in treating TNBC."

The primary aim of the current study was to identify critical proteins that may play roles in opposing the antisurvival effect of the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib together with the calcium-chelator BAPTA-AM in cancer cells using label-free LC-MS/MS. In addition, based on the results of the proteomic technique, a novel and more effective inhibitor combination involving bortezomib as well as OTSSP167 was developed for breast cancer cells. METHODS AND RESULTS: Using label-free LC-MS/MS, it was found that expressions of 1266 proteins were significantly changed between the experimental groups. Among these proteins were cell division cycle 5-like (Cdc5L) and drebrin-like (DBNL). We then hypothesized that inhibition of the activities of these two proteins may lead to more effective anticancer inhibitor combinations in the presence of proteasomal inhibition. In fact, as presented in the current study, Cdc5L phosphorylation inhibitor CVT-313 and DBNL phosphorylation inhibitor OTSSP167 were highly cytotoxic in 4T1 breast cancer cells and their IC(50) values were 20.1 and 43 nM, respectively. Under the same experimental conditions, the IC(50) value of BAPTA-AM was found 19.9 muM. Using WST 1 cytotoxicity assay, it was determined that 10 nM bortezomib + 10 nM CVT-313 was more effective than the control, the single treatments, or than 5 nM bortezomib + 5 nM CVT-313. Similarly, 10 nM bortezomib + 10 nM OTSSP167 was more cytotoxic than the control, the monotherapies, 5 nM bortezomib + 5 nM OTSSP167, or than 5 nM bortezomib + 10 nM OTSSP167, indicating that bortezomib + OTSSP167 was also more effective than bortezomib + CVT-313 in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, the 3D spheroid model proved that bortezomib + OTSSP167 was more effective than the monotherapies as well as bortezomib + CVT-313 and bortezomib + BAPTA-AM combinations. Finally, the effect of bortezomib + OTSSP167 combination was tested on MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells, and it similarly determined that 20 nM bortezomib +40 nM OTSSP167 combination completely blocked the formation of 3D spheroids. CONCLUSIONS: Altogether, the results presented here indicate that bortezomib + OTSSP167 is a novel and effective combination and may be tested further for cancer treatment in vivo and in clinical settings."
