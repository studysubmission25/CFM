7987243,Advantages of the scanning ion microscopy for mapping halogen corticoids in normal and transformed cells in culture.,"Berry JP, Chaintreau M, Chassoux D, Dennebouy R, Escaig F, Galle P, Rossignol JM, Slodzian G, Tlouzeau S",Biol Cell. 1994;81(1):65-72. doi: 10.1016/0248-4900(94)90056-6.,1994,,81,1,65-72,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7987243,"The intra-cellular distribution of eight halogen glucocorticoids was investigated by ion microscopy in two cellular varieties of cultured non-cancer cells (fibroblast 3T3) and cancer cells (human breast tumor cells MCF-7). Two types of ion microscopy helped to determine this distribution, a direct imaging ion microscope (SMI 300) with low spatial resolution, and a scanning ion microscope (IMS4F), featuring high resolution, serving to obtain maps representing the intra-cellular distribution of the fluorine elements and drugs present in these monolayer cultured cells. The fluorine images representative of the drugs containing fluorine showed that these drugs are essentially concentrated in the cell nuclei. In these nuclei, the distribution of these drugs is different from that of heterochromatin and of the nucleolus."
