38642912,Disrupting B and T-cell collaboration in autoimmune disease: T-cell engagers versus CAR T-cell therapy?,"Shah K, Leandro M, Cragg M, Kollert F, Schuler F, Klein C, Reddy V",Clin Exp Immunol. 2024 Jun 20;217(1):15-30. doi: 10.1093/cei/uxae031.,2024 Jun 20,10.1093/cei/uxae031,217,1,15-30,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38642912,"B and T cells collaborate to drive autoimmune disease (AID). Historically, B- and T-cell (B-T cell) co-interaction was targeted through different pathways such as alemtuzumab, abatacept, and dapirolizumab with variable impact on B-cell depletion (BCD), whereas the majority of patients with AID including rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, multiple sclerosis, and organ transplantation benefit from targeted BCD with anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies such as rituximab, ocrelizumab, or ofatumumab. Refractory AID is a significant problem for patients with incomplete BCD with a greater frequency of IgD-CD27+ switched memory B cells, CD19+CD20- B cells, and plasma cells that are not directly targeted by anti-CD20 antibodies, whereas most lymphoid tissue plasma cells express CD19. Furthermore, B-T-cell collaboration is predominant in lymphoid tissues and at sites of inflammation such as the joint and kidney, where BCD may be inefficient, due to limited access to key effector cells. In the treatment of cancer, chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy and T-cell engagers (TCE) that recruit T cells to induce B-cell cytotoxicity have delivered promising results for anti-CD19 CAR T-cell therapies, the CD19 TCE blinatumomab and CD20 TCE such as mosunetuzumab, glofitamab, or epcoritamab. Limited evidence suggests that anti-CD19 CAR T-cell therapy may be effective in managing refractory AID whereas we await evaluation of TCE for use in non-oncological indications. Therefore, here, we discuss the potential mechanistic advantages of novel therapies that rely on T cells as effector cells to disrupt B-T-cell collaboration toward overcoming rituximab-resistant AID."

Despite advances in therapeutics, a substantial number of patients succumb to the disease. Several subtypes of leukemia are inherently more resistant to treatment despite intensive chemotherapy or targeted therapy. METHODS: Here we describe the generation of T cell engaging (CD3) bispecific antibodies (BsAbs) built on humanized IgG frameworks using the IgG(L)-scFv format against two targets expressed on acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and on acute myeloid leukemia (AML). RESULTS: Each BsAb mediated potent anti-leukemia effect against ALL (CD19) and AML (CD33) in vitro and in xenograft models. Importantly, the CD19-specific BsAb (BC250) was effective against hematogenous spread preventing metastases to liver and kidney in mice bearing ALL and Burkitt's lymphoma xenografts. BC250 was more potent than the The Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved BsAb blinatumomab against ALL xenografts in vivo as measured by tumor bioluminescence and mouse survival. Furthermore, the combination of the CD19 and CD33 BsAbs in two xenograft models of mixed phenotype acute leukemia (biphenotypic and bilineal leukemia) was far superior than monotherapy with either of the BsAbs alone. CONCLUSIONS: Selective combinations of these leukemia-specific BsAb offer the potential to overcome tumor heterogeneity or clonal escape in the modern era of antibody-based T cell-driven immunotherapy."
